Our College’s commitment to being caring-centric in who we are and all we do, as well as our leadership 
in caring science is what drew me to FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. This, in combination with 
our diverse, talented student body, staff and faculty, and our trifecta of holistic education, clinical and 
service opportunities, and research programs makes the College a model for global nursing excellence 
like no other. I can sincerely state: I absolutely love Florida Atlantic University and our College of Nursing; 
our community of faculty, staff, students, alumni, donors, and all of our campus, clinical and community 
partners. I remain grateful to our College community, and Drs. Boykin and Smith for paving the way and 
creating a strong legacy for the College over the past four decades.
The past 40 years of our College’s history have been phenomenal. We have top ranked, accredited 
educational programs that are endorsed by the American Holistic Nurses Association. Graduates of our 
BSN program have the top 1% highest NCLEX pass rates in Florida and across the nation. Our faculty have 
obtained funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration to support innovative educational 
and training opportunities for our students, including those who are veterans. The College’s research portfolio has grown 
exponentially. Our faculty have successfully secured funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Patient Centered 
Outcomes Research Institute and other external sources to support their cutting-edge research. Additionally, several 
faculty hold prestigious national and international fellowships, including those in the American Academy of Nursing, 
the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the National Academies of Practice. Several faculty have also been 
selected for state and national awards for excellence in research, education and practice.
Our College of Nursing is also unique in having two nurse-led clinical health centers: The Louis and Anne Green Memory 
and Wellness Center (MWC) and the FAU Community Health Center (CHC). The MWC, which is based less than a 
mile away from the College, offers evidence-based programs and high quality, inter-professional, team-based care to 
participants in the Adult Day Center and patients in the Memory Disorder Clinic. The CHC, located in the Westgate 
area, continues to meet the health needs of a very vulnerable and underserved population—the majority of whom 
are uninsured or underinsured. We continue to seek additional funding sources to support the center and its patients, 
especially since we did not receive funding through the Federally Qualifed Health Center program as a new access 
point. However, we remain committed to caring.
I am very hopeful about the College’s future as a leader in caring science, as well as a nationally-ranked leading College 
of Nursing and model for nurse-led, caring-centric, health centers for vulnerable, underserved populations. I bring to 
this deanship a passion for people and a particularly unique skillset. First, I served as a research dean and nurse scientist 
focused on holistic health and health outcomes research at two research-intensive universities in the southeastern U.S. 
and a fellow of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Interdisciplinary Research Leaders program. Second, I am a current 
member of the board of directors of Sigma, the international honor society for nursing, and also have previous board 
leadership experience. Third, I am a board-certifed Adult Nurse Practitioner and previous interim Chief Nursing and 
Medical Offcer at two previous outpatient clinics. Lastly, in my role as nursing faculty and previous Faculty-in-Residence 
at two universities, I lived on campus with and mentored honors students, including nursing students. I strongly believe 
that the congruence of my skills, expertise and passion for people—with those of our faculty, staff and advisory boards 
will enable us to continue to both excel as before and to lead in new, exciting ways. Together, we at the Christine E. Lynn 
College of Nursing will continue to:  1) achieve and lead in global nursing excellence; 2) prepare the next generation 
of caring nurse leaders; 3) address the national nursing shortage; 4) help eliminate health disparities; 5) generate new 
knowledge; 6) provide innovative models for care; and 7) create a culture of health and caring.

This issue of Transforming Care celebrates the 40th anniversary of FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of 
Nursing. The theme of our anniversary year is “Honoring our Past…Visioning our Future,” so this is a time 
for us to both refect on where we’ve been and where we want to go. As the Dean for the past eight years, 
I have been privileged to lead talented and dedicated faculty, staff and students who embraced a vision 
of excellence, expansion and engagement. I’m proud of how we’ve worked together to realize this vision. 
The College was built on a foundation of excellence. Our commitment to advancing caring science in the 
missions of teaching, research and service has distinguished the College. We are known for our focus on 
holistic, person-centered caring.  We have continued to showcase the uniqueness and excellence of the 
College. This excellence has been recognized as we rose in the U.S. News & World Report rankings to the 
top 50 for our graduate programs and in the top 25 for our online graduate programs.  Our NCLEX pass 
rates and nurse practitioner certifcation pass rates are among the best in the Florida, and our graduates 
are sought after by employers.  We’ve grown our scholarly productivity and increased external funding for 
faculty research. The College is recruiting top students to our programs, and we are one of the most diverse student 
bodies in the nation. Most of our amazing alumni are practicing in South Florida, and they are making a difference in 
the health of our communities.  Our excellent faculty have received honors from local, state and national organizations.  
The College expanded enrollment and educational programs.  In 1979, the program began as a small RN to BSN program 
and has grown to enroll about 1,400 students in four degree programs.  In 2014, the College launched its freshman direct 
admit track and nearly quadrupled pre-licensure enrollment. A psychiatric mental-health nurse practitioner concentration 
was developed in 2016 to address the critical lack of access to behavioral healthcare in the region.  A new part-time 
second degree program started at the Davie campus in Fall 2019. Our two nurse-led interprofessional centers have 
expanded their services and reach.  The Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center added a new building and 
programs for those with Parkinson’s Disease and their families.  The College of Nursing Community Health Center in 
Westgate is planning to co-locate in the northwest community. 
Community engagement is a hallmark of the College, and includes partnerships and outreach within and beyond FAU 
to community organizations, other educational institutions, businesses and healthcare organizations locally and globally. 
Recently, the College received more than $7 million in HRSA funding to build innovative education-practice partnerships 
to enhance primary care.  Faculty and students have participated in innovative practicums and study abroad programs 
in Oklahoma and Guatemala that provide opportunities for service learning.  Students and faculty have advocated for 
important public health issues.  The dedicated College of Nursing advisory boards support the College in the community.
Serving as Dean of this very special College has been an honor and joy.  This year, I left the deanship to join the faculty, 
and pursue my passions for teaching and writing.  I confdently pass the baton to Dean George, and look forward to 
supporting her as she leads the College to new heights.  During this 40th anniversary year, FAU’s Christine E. Lynn 
College of Nursing can take pride in our past, and anticipate a bold and bright future! 
Sincerely,
Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAAN

WITH WRITING WORKSHOPS
through research
FAU’s College of Nursing hosted a series of Manuscript Writing Groups over the past year. Five bi-weekly groups convened, 
comprised of 3-5 participants, and organized into clusters of faculty members and PhD students.  This was a new initiative, 
directed by the College’s Research Offce, intended to support faculty and PhD student scholarship.  Participants incrementally 
worked on manuscripts for publication while receiving feedback from peers.  
For participants, the groups were a valuable aid to their scholarship, providing space to refect on research results and refne 
dissemination of fndings.  Participants noted how the groups helped them stay “on track” with their manuscripts.  
The real value of the groups to participants, however, was in the team-based feedback approach.  Participants read each other’s 
work and noted areas of strength and improvement, bringing their individual and cumulative knowledge to bear on each other’s 
writing.  This encouraged cross-pollination of ideas and also mimicked the way all public writing exists – as part of a larger 
community of writers and readers.  Dr. Gail Sullivan, Visiting Assistant Professor and participant, remarked on the benefts of the 
peer review format, “Listening to the group comments helped me to organize my work and see it in a new way.”  
The groups were facilitated by Alice Espinosa Miehl, who holds a PhD in English.  Dr. Miehl has extensive experience leading grant 
writing and other scholarly workshops, having worked in the feld of research development for nearly 12 years.  Previously, as a 
composition instructor, she learned the benefts of peer review.  That experience helped to inform the design and development 
of the manuscript groups.  
Dr. Patricia Liehr, Associate Dean for Nursing Research and Scholarship, noted that through the writing workshops, Dr. Miehl 
provided structure for successful publication. She said, “As a member of one of the writing groups, I was able to engage with 
Alice and colleagues in honest dialogue about my writing, helping me decide on the manuscript focus and get it submitted.”

HONOREES DISCUSS  
COLLEGE’S Legacy
Christine E. Lynn, the College’s namesake philanthropist, has long advocated for the needs of our 
South Florida community. Her relentless dedication to the health of Boca Raton and to nursing 
education at Florida Atlantic University is a living, growing legacy. Christine (CEL) recently sat 
down with Dean Emeritus Anne Boykin (AB) and Dr. Marlaine Smith (MS) to discuss the history and 
importance of the College to the community. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:
MS: What is the most vivid impression you have of your frst meeting together?
CEL: My husband arranged for Anne and I to meet so she could show me the College of Nursing 
at FAU at that time. In that frst meeting, I remember the enthusiasm and excitement Anne had in 
her heart about nursing and caring for patients. I must say though I had never been to a nursing 
school that looked so old. I remember Anne said her dream one day would be to have a stand-alone 
College of Nursing. Her dream came true after my husband died, and I’m very excited to see what has 
happened since that time. And, we must remember Lucy Edmondson, Frank Newman, and Charles 
and Dorothy Schmidt, who provided much needed funding to start the nursing program many years 
ago. 
AB: I remember Christine’s unending questions and concern. I could tell this wasn’t quite how she 
envisioned a building for the study of nursing. But, her passion and love for nursing is what struck me 
in the beginning and forever.
MS: Tell us a little bit about the early years of the College of Nursing.
AB: I arrived in 1981 as faculty. I always wanted to be in a program that was truly devoted to the study 
of the nursing discipline, where everybody was passionate in their own way about making the discipline 
live. We had a small group of faculty, and we got together. I shared my dream of creating a new way to 
study nursing. Everybody agreed to do this, knowing that once we do this some people currently there 
may not be interested in staying because it is going to be different. A couple people did choose to 
leave. But, it was the most exciting journey of my life to really fgure out how we can study this beautiful 
discipline and really make a difference in how future students care. All along, caring was an important 
concept, but it grew to where we really understood the depth of that concept and continues to grow 
today. It has put us in a very unique position nationally and internationally. I’m so proud of the hard 
work of faculty and students to achieve that.
MS: What inspired you and Gene to give so generously to support the College of Nursing?
CEL: Gene did that because he knew how much I cared about my career as an RN, and he wanted me 
to feel good about not working following our marriage. In 1983, he provided a gift for the frst Christine 
E. Lynn Eminent Scholar Chair in Nursing for the advancement of nursing. It made me very proud. Even 
though I couldn’t work, at least I was doing something for the profession I love.
AB: We were such a small division of nursing at that time. To have an eminent scholar chair to recruit 
a renowned researcher to begin to do the work, it was crazy because we were so little. And, of 
course, Christine and Gene continued their support through student scholarships, and their faculty 
development fund to retain and recruit the best faculty. It made such a signifcant difference.

     <text><![CDATA[MS: There is so much community support for the College of Nursing. How did that support 
evolve and why do you think donors supported the College? 
 
CEL: The community knows it is important to have quality nurses. If you get sick, you want someone 
who cares about you and supports you, and helps you through the anxiety you might be experiencing 
HONOREES DISCUSS  
when you are sick. Without nurses, doctors wouldn’t be able to do their work either.
AB: I think to garner support you have to garner trust. Over time, as friends of the College began 
to witness the types of activities we were doing to truly make a difference, and they saw the level of 
support from people like Christine, who they respect highly, they trusted we were on a very important 
mission. They wholeheartedly supported our path, students and faculty, and believed dearly in what we 
COLLEGE’S Legacy
were doing in a very deliberate, passionate way.
MS: Tell us about your early discussions and meetings about the new building.
AB: It was a dream come true. I had hoped for a spot on campus to have a building. Christine was 
so instrumental in making it happen. I was so thrilled about the possibilities of how we could build a 
building that would refect our passion for caring … Christine and I met with the architect and other 
planning groups. I met with every new group, brick layers and others, to let them know what they were 
doing was helping to create a healing space. It mattered to them, and they became very involved in 
the process.
MS: What matters most to you about the College of Nursing?
AB: It’s important the mission of our College continues. We hold strong the pillars on which our 
college was built and hold dear the values that guided us over 40 years. We continue to unfold such a 
remarkable College through the work of all faculty, staff and students. The mission is grounded in an 
understanding and living of the concept of caring. That is why we have the Archives of Caring in the 
College, as a gift to future generations for hundreds of years to come, so they come and study that 
work. That matters more than anything to me.
CEL: I agree with Anne. And, we want to grow and produce more nurses, and, hopefully, they will stay 
in our community.
AB: Yes, we hope research and teaching continues to be innovative and grounded in caring.

SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
CHRYSTELLE PIERRE  recipient of the Kay Carpenter scholarship, is an RN pursuing a Bachelor 
of Science Degree in Nursing. She hopes her nursing degree will allow her to bring evidenced-based 
knowledge to her unit, helping them to embody a culture of caring. She appreciates opportunities to 
serve her community, teach, advocate, and provide health and wellness services to those around her. Upon 
receiving the scholarship, Chrystelle said, “I knew that fnancial barriers were no longer of issue, and it 
helped me fulfll my dreams. It has given me the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of nursing theory, 
research and leadership.” Chrystelle appreciates the informative, organized and fexible nature of the 
program for working RNs. “I would highly recommend this program to anyone,” she said.   
ALEXANDRA RICH  recently graduated from FAU with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and is now 
pursuing a Doctor of Nursing Practice in the Family Nurse Practitioner BSN to DNP program. After obtaining 
her DNP, she hopes to work as an FNP in a women’s health clinic or pediatric practice, and would like to 
one day serve the nursing profession as an educator. Alexandra was inspired to pursue nursing, in part, on a 
medical mission trip to remote villages in the mountains of Honduras. “While I was able to witness countless 
interesting medical cases, and provide care and health education to the patients I saw, the most striking part 
of the trip was the sheer appreciation the villagers had for us. This experience empowered me to pursue 
nursing and adopt a lifestyle of service to others,” she said. She appreciates the unlimited opportunities 
nurses have to develop and grow throughout their careers. She said the Kay Carpenter scholarship gave her 
the peace of mind she needed to focus more on her studies. 
DIANNA HERRERA 
recently graduated with a master’s degree in Holistic Health Nursing and is a 
recipient of the Thomas Fund scholarship. She hopes to work in the feld of integrative and holistic medicine 
to utilize all that she has learned in a practice setting. She wants to one day own a wellness center focused 
on nurse coaching, yoga, meditation and art therapy. She chose nursing because she has always enjoyed 
caring, educating, and helping others obtain goals toward better health in a holistic way. “I knew nursing 
would allow me the opportunity to work in many settings, provide new opportunities and always push me 
to learn more,” said Dianna. Her favorite aspect of nursing is the one-on-one, personal connection with 
patients, whether in person or electronically. The scholarship helped her cover the cost of classes and books 
while she worked full-time in children’s ministry and as a faith-based community nurse. “I absolutely love the 
caring vision of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing.  We are taught to not only care for our patients, 
but ourselves. One semester I was honored to have the dean as my advisor. She took time to follow up with 
me, talk to me, and let me know she was there for guidance and support,” she said.
RIVKA AVERBUKH recipient of a Hugh & Anny Godsey Scholarship, is pursuing a Doctorate of Nursing 
Practice degree. She says her ultimate goal in the nursing profession is “to contribute in the refnement 
process of our healthcare system that would alleviate socioeconomic disparities, as well as improve morale 
and the health of our society as a whole.” Her favorite aspect of nursing is doing meaningful work. “Since we 
spend most of our lives working, I wanted a career that would give me a sense of purpose, and would allow 
me to use my creativity to leave the world a little bit better than how I found it.”  She said her scholarship 
gave her the ability to further her education and helped her worry less about money for tuition, books, and 
other expenses.  She has enjoyed her experience in the College, gaining experience in various subjects and 
through clinical rotations. She said the required courses of the DNP program have given her a wide breadth 
of insight into healthcare policy and primary care training. “The faculty members are very approachable and 
sincerely want students to succeed and make an impact.”

concentration in Behavioral and Mental Health. A Freshman Direct Admit nursing student, he is a recipient 
of the Essie C. Crain Scholarship. After obtaining his degree, he hopes to work in a Neuro ICU to help 
patients recover from neurological defcits. Jayson chose a career in nursing because he wanted to serve 
others. At frst he was unsure of which path to take, but appreciated that nursing gave him the fexibility 
to choose from among many career options.  “I later chose my double major after gaining a heightened 
curiosity on the brain and how it works. I was even further pushed to this calling after my father's stroke and 
learning just how scary it is to be in patients' families’ shoes.” Among the many reasons he chose the FAU 
College of Nursing was its investment in research.  “Any nursing program can give you the questions to 
answer, but not every college will ask you to create questions that have never been asked and give you the 
resources to seek those answers.”   
SHIRLEY CONRAD 
recipient of a scholarship from the Evelyn Weinberger Nursing Endowment, 
is pursuing a doctorate in nursing. After obtaining her degree, she hopes to work professionally as a 
nurse scientist. When frst determining what to study, Shirley had to narrow down her options. She chose 
nursing, and early on thought she would work as a midwife, but decided instead to specialize in surgical 
trauma. “Nursing is a profession with autonomy that provides innumerable avenues to practice. This allows 
individuals with a variety of interests, passions, and gifts to impact humanity in ways that align with their 
core.” She was initially attracted to FAU’s College of Nursing because of the graduate-level Holistic Nursing 
program. “My cohort was the frst to go through the program. Upon entering my program, the caring 
philosophy of the College and expertise in caring science opened my mind to a body of work I was not yet 
aware of. This work touched me deeply, and I enjoyed exploring it.”
LINDSAY HAYES 
BSN, RN, is pursuing the Family Nurse Practitioner program of the Master's of 
Science in Nursing degree. She is a recipient of the Helen L. Morley Scholarship for Nursing Students. 
While she is still determining which clinical area in which she will practice, her goal is to give back to her 
community of Brevard County, Florida. “We have such a large need for primary care services. I want to make 
sure that I am able to help fll some of that need,” she said.  She says she always knew she wanted to take 
care of people in some way, and that the versatility of a degree in nursing was appealing. Lindsay’s favorite 
aspect of nursing is providing bedside care and developing personal relationships with patients and their 
family members. As a single mother of two children, her scholarships were instrumental in paying for classes, 
books, supplies, and the cost of transportation back and forth to clinicals. Lindsay attends FAU’s Harbor 
Branch campus and takes online courses. “The faculty have been informative, nurturing, and empathetic to 
real life and family situations that have come about throughout the program. I chose this program with high 
hopes and have not been disappointed. I have recommended several colleagues to the program.” 
JOHANNA JOB is pursuing a Master of Science in Nursing degree in the Family Nurse Practitioner 
track. A recipient of the Rothenberger Scholarship, she is interested in primary care and neurology, and 
also has a special interest in caring for underserved populations. Johanna was inspired to pursue nursing 
after spending time with APRNs who cared for her father throughout his illness and passing. “Nursing is 
a humbling profession that allows both the patient and nurse to learn and grow from one another.  It is a 
profession that integrates an art and science in delivering optimal patient- and family-centered care,” she 
said. The Rothenberger scholarship allowed her to cover some of her program expenses, including tuition 
and textbooks.
