MS: There is so much community support for the College of Nursing. How did that support evolve and why do you think donors supported the College?  CEL: The community knows it is important to have quality nurses. If you get sick, you want someone who cares about you and supports you, and helps you through the anxiety you might be experiencing HONOREES DISCUSS  when you are sick. Without nurses, doctors wouldn’t be able to do their work either.AB: I think to garner support you have to garner trust. Over time, as friends of the College began to witness the types of activities we were doing to truly make a difference, and they saw the level of support from people like Christine, who they respect highly, they trusted we were on a very important mission. They wholeheartedly supported our path, students and faculty, and believed dearly in what we COLLEGE’S Legacywere doing in a very deliberate, passionate way.MS: Tell us about your early discussions and meetings about the new building.AB: It was a dream come true. I had hoped for a spot on campus to have a building. Christine was so instrumental in making it happen. I was so thrilled about the possibilities of how we could build a building that would refect our passion for caring … Christine and I met with the architect and other planning groups. I met with every new group, brick layers and others, to let them know what they were doing was helping to create a healing space. It mattered to them, and they became very involved in the process.MS: What matters most to you about the College of Nursing?AB: It’s important the mission of our College continues. We hold strong the pillars on which our college was built and hold dear the values that guided us over 40 years. We continue to unfold such a remarkable College through the work of all faculty, staff and students. The mission is grounded in an understanding and living of the concept of caring. That is why we have the Archives of Caring in the College, as a gift to future generations for hundreds of years to come, so they come and study that work. That matters more than anything to me.CEL: I agree with Anne. And, we want to grow and produce more nurses, and, hopefully, they will stay in our community.AB: Yes, we hope research and teaching continues to be innovative and grounded in caring. 33
