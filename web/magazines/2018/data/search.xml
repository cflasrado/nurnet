This issue of Transforming Care is themed “Caring through Advocacy.”  We know the health of communities 
is infuenced by policies and practices.  Caring often involves working to change or sustain policies and 
practices that enhance health and quality of life for the public.  This year, our College was involved in this 
important work of advocacy.  
In 2018, the College of Nursing’s Student Nurses Association (SNA) was named as the Diamond Chapter 
of the Florida Nursing Student Organization (FNSA) for the second year in a row.  This is the top FNSA 
honor and a testament to our students’ ambitious advocacy work.  They hosted a legislative forum, inviting 
local and state representatives to the College to discuss important health-related issues. The students 
discovered that through advocacy they have the ability to impact laws and improve health care for 
underserved populations.  
In January, 27 students and fve faculty boarded a bus to Tallahassee to attend the Florida Nurses 
Association’s Advocacy Days.  Students learned to effectively communicate with legislators about pending bills that had 
the potential to impact nursing and healthcare.  
Students who attended the FNSA and National Student Nurses Association (NSNA) conventions returned inspired 
to become nurse leaders.  Five students now hold offce at the state level, and one student has a position on the 
NSNA Resolution Committee. Our chapter had important resolutions passed at both the FNSA and NSNA conferences, 
examples of living caring through advocacy. 
When Hurricane Irma hit our community, Drs. Rhonda Goodman and Beth King, and a group of students staffed a shelter 
at Boca Raton High School.  Later, they realized something more had to be done to increase the number of nurses 
prepared to respond in disasters and emergencies.  Dr. Goodman advocated for holding Red Cross disaster trainings, 
and with her commitment, over 120 nursing students completed the program, became certifed, and are now better 
prepared to assist in disasters.  
The massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14 left our community reeling with sadness, anger 
and determination to advocate for change.  “Never Again!” became a rallying cry. Students and faculty formed the 
group Nurses Advocating for Peace and Safety (NAPS) to advocate for policies to address the public health issue of 
gun violence.  NAPS members participated in the March for our Lives in Washington, DC and Boca Raton. Through a 
letter-writing campaign to lawmakers, they advocated for better mental health care and common-sense gun legislation. 
They sponsored an active shooter training at the College.  With concerns for the well-being of families separated at 
our borders, NAPS members joined the Families Belong Together marches to advocate for reunifcation of families in 
accordance with the positions of our professional nursing organizations. 
Advocacy is an expression of caring.  Nurses have a responsibility to advocate for the health and well-being of individuals, 
families and populations.  I’m so proud of the important advocacy work of our students and faculty.   
 
Sincerely,
Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAAN

Research on non-pharmacologic approaches to save 
veterans’ lives is almost non-existent. C-P.A.W.W. was 
created in response to the dearth of vital information 
regarding the healing capacities of the human-animal 
interaction. Her team’s mission is to provide rigorous 
empirical evidence demonstrating the lifesaving 
impact canines may have on the underserved veteran 
population. Two of Dr. Krause-Parello’s foci are Invisible 
Wounds of War and Treating Trauma through Canine 
Interaction. 
INVISIBLE WOUNDS OF WAR
An estimated 22 U.S. military veterans die each day 
by suicide—more than are lost daily in combat. The 
U.S. veteran population, approximately 2.4 million, is 
expected to surge in the next fve years with another 1 
million active and reserve members of the U.S. armed 
forces returning to civilian life. C-P.A.W.W. helps expand 
the College’s efforts of investigating how to reduce 
the risk factors for suicide in the military population, 
and improve the understanding of palliative effects of 
animal-assisted interventions in wounded warriors and 
military veterans. 
TREATING TRAUMA THROUGH CANINE

Service dogs are specially trained to sense a veteran’s 
anxiety, serve as a calming infuence through pressure 
therapy, and help a veteran feel safer in a crowded 
public area. Veterans with a service dog can positively

independence. However, in many cases, service dogs

“For many veterans, returning home from service means 
facing the struggle of reintegrating into life’s daily 
routine,” says Dr. Krause-Parello. “That struggle may 
evolve into suicidal tendencies. The C-P.A.W.W. initiative 
seeks to change that.”

EUGENIA MILLENDER, PHD, RN, MS, PMHNP-BC, CDE
Born in Panama, Dr. Eugenia Millender’s frst language is Spanish. 
She immigrated with her family at the age of 12, frst to New York 
and then to South Florida. After graduating from high school 
in West Palm Beach, Eugenia enlisted in the Army and spent 
the next six years stationed around the globe. While in 
the Army, she took classes wherever she was stationed, 
earning an Associate of Arts degree from the College 
of Lake County in Illinois. After her enlistment, she 
returned to Florida and enrolled at FAU, completing 
three degrees. Dr. Millender's time in the military 
instilled the discipline and management skills 
needed to cope with a busy life as an employee, 
student, wife and mother. She acknowledges 
that her achievements would not be possible 
without the unwavering support of her 
husband, Donald Millender, and their children.
Dr. Millender’s career in nursing has been 
dedicated to increasing access to quality 
care, decreasing health disparities, and 
providing a culturally sensitive environment 
for both patients and their communities.  She 
has more than 20 years of experience working 
with community-based teams and vulnerable 
populations. Dr. Millender is a psychiatric nurse 
practitioner and a doctorally-prepared nurse 
scientist. Her program of research focuses on 
stress and trauma that is often related to mental 
illness, substance abuse and chronic disease among 
indigenous, minority and underserved groups. 
She is working with community-based organizations 
to study the effcacy of mental health, diabetes and 
substance abuse prevention and treatment interventions 
for underserved populations.
Dr. Millender is the Founding Director for the FAU

Following an extraordinary,

international career bridging 
divides of distance and 
language, Kay Carpenter 
was inspired to give back 
to the nursing profession. 
“Nursing students shouldn’t 
have to interrupt their 
studies to work,” said 
Carpenter. “During my 
career, I saw students 
struggling and dropping out 
of school. I wanted to help 
minimize this hardship for 
others.”
Carpenter said she chose 
to give to FAU’s College 
of Nursing after evaluating the excellence in a variety of nursing 
programs at colleges and universities in the region. She found 
the NCLEX exam scores and numbers of students fnishing on 
time were the highest at the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. 
She said she was also impressed with the FAU nursing students 
and graduates she encountered during a recent hospitalization, 
noting their high level of skill and good rapport with patients. 
“I hope that this scholarship will encourage young people to 
go into the nursing profession and keep up with their studies 
because it is an important career.  It is easy to get discouraged 
during the course of your studies. I think FAU’s College of Nursing 
is an important school in our region, and I encourage young 
people, including those with families, to look into the possibility 
of a nursing career,” she said.

GERTRUDE E. SKELLY CHARITABLE 
FOUNDATION
hen an FAU nursing student lost her child tragically in 
a car accident, she was planning to drop out of school 
to work and earn the funds necessary to pay for a 
W
funeral.  Advised by faculty that this outstanding student 
who had a 4.0 grade-point average was planning to end her 
nursing studies and possibly her future career, the Gertrude 
E. Skelly Charitable Foundation stepped in and, at the time, 
anonymously donated funds to pay for the funeral and help 
the student through this hardship. This is just one example 
of the kind of need-based support the foundation provides 
to nursing students across the nation.
Each year, the Skelly Foundation awards between $800,000 
and $1 million to students at approximately 30 universities 
across the U.S., with most gifts focused on assisting promising 
nursing students during fnancial diffculties that would cause 
them to put their education on hold. “We want them to 
remain in school and become good nurses,” said Erik Joh, 
who is Co-Trustee of the Foundation with SunTrust Bank as his 
partner. Joh was Gertrude Skelly’s attorney and assisted her in 
establishing her foundation as part of her estate plan in 1991. 
Miss Skelly, as she insisted upon being referred to, was a 
fnishing school graduate and devotee of etiquette, who grew 
up and lived in Wilmington, Delaware. During World War II, 
she served in the WAVES, a women’s unit of the U.S. Naval 
Reserve, and taught pilots to fy using simulators. A hallmark 
of her fnishing school background, Miss Skelly cared very 
much about individuals’ training, and spent summers training 
her grand-nieces and nephews in protocol. After her parents 
passed away, she moved to South Florida, where she was an 
avid golfer.  
After being treated by a home healthcare provider and 
spending some time in a hospital, she was inspired to support 
the education and training of nursing and healthcare workers, 
beginning with the Red Cross and the then-Palm Beach Junior 
College. “Miss Skelly met with nursing students and liked what 
she saw,” said Joh.
Miss Skelly passed away in 1995, and a few years later, Joh and 
his then-fellow representative of Co-Trustee SunTrust bank, 
Paul Xylander, began working with the FAU College of Nursing 
and former-Dean Anne Boykin. In 1998, the two surprised 
Boykin with a $50,000 gift. “We’ve had a delightful relationship 
with FAU,” said Joh, adding that Miss Skelly would have 
appreciated the College’s philosophy and practice of Caring. 
“We like the attitude of FAU nursing students, that they want 
to learn and serve,” said Melanie Cianciotto Joh’s working 
partner and current representative of Foundation Co-Trustee, 
SunTrust Bank.
Joh said each year the Skelly Foundation attends banquets 
for its grantees hosted by their nursing schools and lets 
them know they have been the benefciary of Miss Skelly’s 
will. “Though she never knew you, she cared about you. You 
are improving the health of your community and supporting 
your families.”

She is also the College’s liaison to the Graduate Student Academy. Ayse holds Master of Science in Nursing 
and Master of Business Administration degrees. She is focusing her dissertation research on examining 
the impact of bio-behavioral risk and protective factors on Alzheimer’s Disease. She hopes her work can 
guide prevention strategies for adults with mild-cognitive impairment. After earning her degree, she would 
like to serve as a faculty member and develop her program of research in cognitive aging in vulnerable 
populations. Nursing frst inspired Ayse when she was in middle school. “I admired the nurses caring for my 
mother after her surgery. I experienced their unconditional caring for my mother and me.” She values and is 
driven by the compassionate aspect of nursing. Ayse said opportunities afforded to her by her scholarship, 
including networking with nursing scholars from other universities, helped her grow tremendously. She most 
appreciates the College’s caring-based philosophy. “Administration and faculty continuously set examples 
… I feel very lucky to be in this College, growing myself as a caring person and scholar.”   
ASHLEY RIVERA 
is a PhD student and recipient of the esteemed Jonas Center for Nursing and 
Veterans Healthcare grant. She is focusing her dissertation work on improving the quality of life for the 
families of children with chronic illnesses, particularly families of children with congenital conditions that 
create chronic medical fragility, such as deMoiser Syndrome, Hurlers Syndrome, and Sickle Cell Disease. 
Ashley holds a Master of Science in Nursing degree and is certifed as a diabetes educator. Upon graduation, 
she would like to work as a nursing faculty member while continuing her research to advance caring science. 
Ashley was working as a frefghter/paramedic when she decided to pursue nursing. She liked the variety of 
career paths available, all of which are connected by caring for others. “Nurses interact with people on their 
worst days. A good nurse can make that day a little less terrible by bringing people comfort.” She is thankful 
for her grant, which eased the fnancial stress of obtaining the degree, while connecting her with other 
Jonas Scholars from across the country, each working on important research. Ashley has enjoyed working 
with outstanding mentors and advisors in the College. “The College attracts elite researchers who mentor 
doctoral students learning to hone their research skills.”

of the D. Burdella Cunningham Scholarship. Cynthia has had a career as an emergency room RN for 19 
years. “I wanted to further my education now that my children are grown, and I have more time.  Also, I 
think it’s important that my children know anyone at any age is able to go to college, you just have to have 
the right mindset and give it your all.” Cynthia’s favorite aspect of nursing is caring for patients and seeing 
dramatic recoveries. She is grateful for her scholarship, which allowed her to continue her education as a 
single mother of three. She also appreciates the fexibility to take courses online while working full-time 
and caring for her family. Cynthia said the program introduced her to new concepts, such as caring and 
community-based nursing, which she had never considered during her career in the ER. “The faculty was 
very supportive and encouraging because I was very nervous after not being in school for over 15 years.” 
She hopes to pursue an advanced nursing degree in the future.

DEBBIE RICHARDS 
recipient of the Essie Crain scholarship. After obtaining her degree, she hopes to work in a surgical unit 
for at least one year before transitioning to the feld of psychiatry. Before entering her nursing program 
Debbie became a Certifed Nursing Assistant and worked in patient care to ensure nursing was the right 
career choice for her. “I quickly realized that I had the passion, dedication and drive to pursue my education 
in nursing, and once I knew that immediately applied,” said Debbie. She enjoys working in the clinical 
environment, caring for people and being involved in their care emotionally and physically. “It is a heartfelt 
moment to put a smile on someone’s face when they need it most,” she said. Her scholarship allowed her 
to concentrate less on fnancial burdens and fully focus on her classes. “I would like to express sincere 
gratitude to the donors for making my dream a reality.”

Employment of Primary Care Providers (REEP) Advanced Nursing Education Workforce traineeship award. 
A native of Romania, who had a long career in journalism abroad, Daniela has lived in three countries 
over the past 15 years and has a unique viewpoint on healthcare. She currently works as a nephrology 
nurse with patients suffering from end-stage renal disease. As an advanced practice nurse, she hopes to 
address barriers to care. Daniela most enjoys the communication aspect of nursing. “I am already learning 
to use communication as a therapeutic tool, and I notice that having a compassionate, nonjudgmental and 
genuinely attentive ear helps you become the healthcare professional everyone aspires to be,” she said. 
Daniela’s scholarship helped defer the costs of her degree while working full-time and caring for her two 
daughters. She is proud to be affliated with the College and FAU, which has been her academic home 
since arriving in the U.S. Daniela holds a master’s degree in communications and a Bachelor of Science in 
Nursing from FAU. “The BSN to DNP program educates us to become advanced practice nurses leading 
the transformation of healthcare toward a more caring and compassionate approach.  And we are changed 
in the process.”   
INDHIRA PIQUION 
 is pursuing a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree with a specialization as an adult/
gerontological nurse practitioner. She received a Recruitment, Education, and Employment of Primary Care 
Providers Advanced Nursing Education Workforce traineeship award. Upon graduation, Indhira plans to 
work in primary care settings as a nurse practitioner in a clinic and would like to work with underserved 
populations. As a young person in Haiti, Indhira was frst fascinated by nurses’ uniforms in the hospital – 
white dresses and caps. After her mother became a nurse, Indhira became further interested in the feld, 
and learned about anatomy and physiology. “I felt that being a nurse was like being a detective. I started 
to embrace the holistic aspect of nursing in regards to caring for the person as a whole,” she said. Indhira’s 
favorite aspects of the profession is seeing a patient return to health and being a part of the team that cares for 
them. She is grateful for her scholarship, which helped her spend more time focusing on her studies. Indhira 
embraces the College’s caring philosophy and theory, which she applies to her professional and personal 
life. “I appreciate the faculty for providing great feedback and support for me since my undergrad degree. 
The program provided a great curriculum that has expanded my knowledge supporting my development as 
a confdent healthcare provider.”

concentration. He is a recipient of the Helen Morley scholarship. Upon graduation and passing board 
exams, he would like to work for a year in an urgent care clinic, gaining as much knowledge and experience 
as possible, then potentially specialize in neurology and cardiology. After a year of clinical experience, he’d 
like to work with underserved populations in Florida, especially South Florida, where he was born and raised. 
Luis knew he wanted to work in healthcare, but couldn’t decide what career path to choose. After starting 
his clinical rotations, he fell in love with the profession and now can’t see himself doing anything else. His 
favorite aspect of nursing is connecting with patients of all backgrounds, and having the goal of wellness 
for each of them. He enjoys being present and listening to his patients. Luis is thankful for his scholarship, 
which allowed him to pay for his books and medical reference applications. “I chose FAU initially because

and fees,” she said.  After earning her DNP, she plans to focus on creating effective and innovative health 
coaching, ftness, and wellness programs in primary care clinics for overweight and obese individuals. 
Maude chose nursing because the profession provides pathways to improve the quality of care and health 
outcomes for patients with chronic health problems. As a part of her studies, she has been especially grateful 
to learn about the caring theory models, and how they promote a healing environment and improve quality 
of life for patients. “The programs were well-structured and provided a fexible option for fulflling my
