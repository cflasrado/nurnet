OVERHEARD: QUICK REFERENCEWhat the community is sayingGUIDE“Advocacy is one of the most important responsibilities we have as nurses. We are the voices for those who are sick and vulnerable. The College of Nursing teaches us to put words Main Offce Numbers Boca Raton Campusinto action through advocacy. The greatest example of this  561-297-6261is the recent founding of Nurses Advocating for Peace and Safety (NAPS) after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  Davie CampusSchool shooting.  As one of the co-founders, I am proud to  954-236-1276be a part of this group.  In a short  time, members of NAPS have written letters to state and national government leaders,   Harbor Branch Oceanographic  organized a group for the March for Our Lives event, and  Institute Campusinstituted mindfulness meditations and Heart Math sessions  772-242-2426for students on campus.
