TRANSFORMING CAREResearch on non-pharmacologic approaches to save veterans’ lives is almost non-existent. C-P.A.W.W. was created in response to the dearth of vital information regarding the healing capacities of the human-animal interaction. Her team’s mission is to provide rigorous empirical evidence demonstrating the lifesaving impact canines may have on the underserved veteran population. Two of Dr. Krause-Parello’s foci are Invisible Wounds of War and Treating Trauma through Canine Interaction. INVISIBLE WOUNDS OF WARAn estimated 22 U.S. military veterans die each day by suicide—more than are lost daily in combat. The U.S. veteran population, approximately 2.4 million, is expected to surge in the next fve years with another 1 million active and reserve members of the U.S. armed forces returning to civilian life. C-P.A.W.W. helps expand the College’s efforts of investigating how to reduce the risk factors for suicide in the military population, and improve the understanding of palliative effects of animal-assisted interventions in wounded warriors and military veterans. TREATING TRAUMA THROUGH CANINE through researchINTERACTIONService dogs are specially trained to sense a veteran’s anxiety, serve as a calming infuence through pressure therapy, and help a veteran feel safer in a crowded public area. Veterans with a service dog can positively reintegrate into civilian life and reestablish a sense of independence. However, in many cases, service dogs are not considered a reimbursable medical expense, Dr. Cheryl Krause-Parello, Professor, College of Nursing and veterans go without the assistance they need. and Faculty Fellow in I-HeAL, founded and directs the C-P.A.W.W.’s research is aimed at investigating the research initiative CANINES PROVIDING ASSISTANCE therapeutic benefts of service animals in improving TO WOUNDED WARRIORS (C-P.A.W.W.). Krause-veteran health and well-being, and providing empirical Parello’s program focuses on biological and psychosocial evidence to change public policy and establish service stress indicators in the military veteran population. dogs as a reimbursable medical expense for military veterans.“For many veterans, returning home from service means facing the struggle of reintegrating into life’s daily routine,” says Dr. Krause-Parello. “That struggle may evolve into suicidal tendencies. The C-P.A.W.W. initiative seeks to change that.”13
