A Message from the DeanThe theme of this edition of Transforming Care is “Well-being through Caring.” The faculty of Florida Atlantic University’s (FAU) Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing defnes nursing as “nurturing the wholeness of person-environment through caring.” The root of the word “health” comes from the Old English word “hælth,” meaning whole. There are diverse defnitions of health, including “absence of disease,” “ability to function,” “high level wellness,” and “well-being as personally experienced.” The College states in its philosophy that “humans choose values that give meaning to living and enhance well-being. Well-being is creating and living the meaning of life. Persons are nurtured in their wholeness and well-being through caring relationships.” The College focuses on well-being through caring in teaching, research, practice and service.  The articles in this magazine showcase examples of this important work. As part of its teaching mission, the College is promoting well-being in the Native American community through an intensive community practicum in partnership with the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma. In response to critical health problems, such as the opioid epidemic, depression/suicide, aggression/violence and the lack of adequate mental health care, the College of Nursing is launching a new advanced practice Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner concentration. Our HRSA-funded project, “Caring-based Academic-Practice Partnerships,” promotes the well-being of underserved communities by creating nurse practitioner practicums in agencies serving diverse, economically-challenged persons.  In this edition of the magazine, we provide examples of research focused on well-being through caring.  Researchers are studying disparities associated with breast cancer screenings in diverse and disadvantaged groups; developing caring interventions for persons with dementia and their caregivers; listening to veterans’ experiences and perceptions to better serve them; testing interventions that can improve the well-being of older adults, and responding to global health concerns beyond our borders.  Our centers and faculty practices are also focused on nurturing well-being through caring.  For example, faculty have partnered with local churches to offer foot care to homeless individuals. We promote holistic well-being through classes on self-care, such as yoga and mindfulness. Our faculty are engaged in global initiatives in Guatemala and Haiti that go beyond treatment and prevention of disease to the well-being of the populations as they defne it.  Finally, we are promoting self-care within our own college community. We joined the American Nurses Association in ®their Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation initiative. Many of our faculty are trained in HeartMath  and mindfulness; we offer yoga classes within the College; and faculty and staff have the opportunity to work at standing desks.  I’m so grateful to our dedicated faculty and staff, talented students, passionate alumni, and generous donors, especially Christine E. Lynn.  We are truly blessed to be joined in the dance of caring persons as we fulfll our purpose of enhancing well-being through caring.   Sincerely,Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAANDean and Helen K.
