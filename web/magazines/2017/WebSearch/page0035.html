SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTSMOULINE GUERRIER is a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student in the Adult Geriatric Nurse Practitioner concentration. She is passionate about caring for older people. “The more nurses we have that specialize in geriatric care, the safer we can make it for our older adults.” In the future, she’d like to practice in an oncology setting or with older adults, and also hopes to be an educator. The trust and personalization of nursing is what drew her to the profession. She also appreciates the fexibility and diversity of a career in nursing. “You have many choices as a nurse – you can go into the legal aspect of nursing, become a healthcare leader or even practice at the bedside.” Mouline is deeply grateful for her Palm Healthcare Foundation scholarship. “When you are struggling fnancially from semester to semester…knowing in your heart that you can’t quit, no matter what – the scholarship shines a new light on the situation.” She appreciates the College of Nursing and her program, which she says has expanded her views and the way she processes information. “The faculty genuinely care about the success of their students. I have grown as an individual and in my career from the mentoring that I have received.” STACEY RAVID is pursuing her PhD in Nursing. Stacey became a nurse 24 years ago, when, while working as an actress, her father had a stroke. She cared for him in the hospital and fell in love with nursing. The nurses and doctors encouraged her, seeing within her the passion and talent for caring for others. “I listened to their feedback and knew that nursing was the path for me,” she said. Her favorite aspect of the nursing profession is hearing people’s stories. Stacey completed her Master’s in Nursing in the role of clinical nurse specialist. She is currently an adjunct faculty member with the College. After graduation, she would like to continue to teach nursing students at a university level, as well as to conduct research. She said she is grateful and humbled by the generosity of donors, like Esther Saylor Rothenberger, who provided her scholarship, which has allowed her to focus solely on her studies.  Ravid said, “I love that the College of Nursing’s philosophy is based on caring. The faculty members are down to earth, approachable and brilliant. The PhD program has elements of creativity. The school, program and faculty honor the individuality and uniqueness of each PhD nursing student.”  is pursuing a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) in the Family Nurse KATIE SHOUPPEPractitioner concentration. She is a recipient of a scholarship from the William and Helen Thomas Nursing Scholarship fund. Upon graduation, she would like to work as an orthopedic nurse practitioner. Katie chose to pursue nursing because she believes she has a gift to serve and extend compassionate care to those in need.  “We take for granted the simple necessities of life,” she said. “Tragedy can hit in an instant and completely alter the patient's ability to care for themselves. I am honored to have a role in their road to recovery.” She is thankful for her scholarship, which was awarded to her in recognition of her academic achievements. “Awards, whether monetary or verbal, are fuel for the journey,” she said. She loves that the College’s caring philosophy aligns closely with her own and admires the College’s faculty. “The faculty are irreplaceable and played a vital role in my success.”33
