The theme of this edition of Transforming Care is “Well-being through Caring.” The faculty of Florida 
Atlantic University’s (FAU) Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing defnes nursing as “nurturing the wholeness 
of person-environment through caring.” The root of the word “health” comes from the Old English word 
“hælth,” meaning whole. There are diverse defnitions of health, including “absence of disease,” “ability 
to function,” “high level wellness,” and “well-being as personally experienced.” The College states in its 
philosophy that “humans choose values that give meaning to living and enhance well-being. Well-being 
is creating and living the meaning of life. Persons are nurtured in their wholeness and well-being through 
caring relationships.” 
The College focuses on well-being through caring in teaching, research, practice and service.  The articles 
in this magazine showcase examples of this important work. 
As part of its teaching mission, the College is promoting well-being in the Native American community 
through an intensive community practicum in partnership with the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma. In response to critical 
health problems, such as the opioid epidemic, depression/suicide, aggression/violence and the lack of adequate mental 
health care, the College of Nursing is launching a new advanced practice Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner 
concentration. Our HRSA-funded project, “Caring-based Academic-Practice Partnerships,” promotes the well-being 
of underserved communities by creating nurse practitioner practicums in agencies serving diverse, economically-
challenged persons.  
In this edition of the magazine, we provide examples of research focused on well-being through caring.  Researchers are 
studying disparities associated with breast cancer screenings in diverse and disadvantaged groups; developing caring 
interventions for persons with dementia and their caregivers; listening to veterans’ experiences and perceptions to 
better serve them; testing interventions that can improve the well-being of older adults, and responding to global health 
concerns beyond our borders.  
Our centers and faculty practices are also focused on nurturing well-being through caring.  For example, faculty have 
partnered with local churches to offer foot care to homeless individuals. We promote holistic well-being through classes 
on self-care, such as yoga and mindfulness. Our faculty are engaged in global initiatives in Guatemala and Haiti that go 
beyond treatment and prevention of disease to the well-being of the populations as they defne it.  
Finally, we are promoting self-care within our own college community. We joined the American Nurses Association in 
®
their Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation initiative. Many of our faculty are trained in HeartMath  and mindfulness; we offer 
yoga classes within the College; and faculty and staff have the opportunity to work at standing desks.  
I’m so grateful to our dedicated faculty and staff, talented students, passionate alumni, and generous donors, especially 
Christine E. Lynn.  We are truly blessed to be joined in the dance of caring persons as we fulfll our purpose of enhancing 
well-being through caring.

Fosters Well-Being through Caring 
This issue of Transforming Care highlights the 
College of Nursing’s emphasis on well-being through 
caring.  Throughout its 38 year history, the College 
has embraced beliefs about the wholeness and 
mutuality of human-environment relationships; well-
being, subjectively defned as creating and living 
what matters most in life; and Caring as a powerful 
instrument in facilitating well-being. The philosophy of 
the College elaborates these shared perspectives that 
guide the tripartite mission of teaching, research and

IS ACROSS THE 
LIFESPAN
College of Nursing faculty advance Caring Science in 
four focus areas.  One of those areas is Healthy Aging

James Galvin, Professor in the Colleges of Medicine 
and Nursing, to   stimulate research in this area. Healthy 
Aging begins at birth and requires attention to health 
across the lifespan. Two examples of externally-funded 
research focused on promoting well-being through 
caring are the studies conducted by Dr. Tarsha Jones 
and Dr. Lisa Wiese.

     <text><![CDATA[Alzheimer’s disease is magnifed in underserved 
rural communities due to sociocultural barriers, 
such as limited healthcare access, education, 
health insurance, income, and ability to navigate 
a complex health system even when services are 
available. Dr. Wiese’s fndings highlight the need 
to educate the public about the risk of Alzheimer’s 
disease and benefts of early detection, such as 
earlier care planning and timely treatment.
With support from the Florida Department of 
Health Education and an Ethel Moore Alzheimer’s 
Research grant, Dr. Wiese is piloting an approach 
to increase dementia awareness and management. 
In this study, Dr. Wiese and her team are training 
local lay health educators to conduct brief 
memory screenings for senior residents living in 
independent and assisted living facilities.  If a 
brief screening indicates that someone has short-
term memory loss, they will be given the option 
to see their usual healthcare provider or be seen 
in their home by a nurse practitioner who will 
conduct a comprehensive geriatric assessment. 
The interprofessional team of lay health educators, 
providers, social workers, and community health 
nurses will provide referrals and needed care. The 
nurse practitioner will conduct home visits and/
or provide referrals for community resources, 
including long-term care planning. This study has 
the potential to promote healthy aging across the 
lifespan by providing early intervention that will 
decrease health disparities and promote well-
being through caring.

GLOBAL HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH  
In response to the World Health Organization’s call for 
comprehensive, coordinated action to improve global 
health, College of Nursing faculty and students are 
engaging in research beyond our borders. 
Diane Gullett, a doctoral student mentored by Dr. Charlotte 
through research
Barry, conducted two research studies in collaboration with 
communities in Haiti. The frst explored the experience of 
health after the 2010 devastating earthquake. In the second 
study, her dissertation research still in process, she focused 
on the experience of suffering through the earthquake. 
The fndings of this research will provide the knowledge 
needed by nurses and other healthcare providers caring 
for persons suffering through a natural disaster. The studies 
can generate valuable global dialogue with the potential to 
advance caring science within nursing. 
In another initiative, faculty and members of the South Florida 
Haiti Project conducted community health assessments in 
Bondeau, Haiti. The community identifed the need for basic 
health services for their children, and in response to this, a 
nurse-led, school-based wellness center was developed. 
The need for mental health care also surfaced during the 
community assessment. This resulted in the design of 
another study. In March 2017, Drs. Beth King and Charlotte 
Barry traveled to Haiti to conduct research with a team of 
volunteers and collaborators. The volunteers included Dr. 
Marilyn Ray, transcultural nursing scholar and Professor 
Emeritus, and Sandra Daccarett, a family nurse practitioner 
and Doctor of Nursing Practice student. Haitian collaborators

CREATING A LEGACY OF WELL-BEING 
THROUGH CARING
At 70, Christine E. Lynn, the College’s namesake philanthropist, refects 
on a legacy of transformative giving that is providing greater well-being 
for the community. “Health and wellness are extremely important to me 
because I have seen so many not getting the care they deserve. To me, 
the greatest gift is to be able to get the best of care possible for yourself 
and your family,” she said.
Lynn’s relentless dedication to improving care and nursing education 
is a living, growing legacy impacting FAU, Boca Raton and the South 
Florida community. She is the principal philanthropist to the Christine 
E. Lynn College of Nursing at FAU, Christine E. Lynn Center for Caring, 
Anne Boykin Institute for the Advancement of Caring in Nursing, and 
Nursing Assistant Scholarships, as well as the Boca Raton Regional 
Hospital’s Christine E. Lynn Heart and Vascular Institute, the Eugene 
and Christine Lynn Cancer Institute and the Christine E. Lynn Women’s 
Health and Wellness Institute. She donated to FAU’s sports medicine 
center in the new Academic-Athletic complex with the expectation that 
the College of Nursing will be a part of the wellness initiatives there.  She 
is also supporting forthcoming projects including the Christine E. Lynn 
Rehabilitation Center and stem cell research at the Miami Project to Cure 
Paralysis, as well as other programs and charities. It’s no wonder that 
when she’s out and about, she hears people whisper, “Do you know who 
that is? She’s the one who does everything for healthcare,” she said. “I’m 
amazed, and it touches my heart.”
She was inspired to become a nurse by a family friend whose daughter 
was a nurse working on a cruise ship. Lynn was educated at the university 
hospital in Oslo, Norway in 1969 and specialized as a surgical nurse 
before becoming the head nurse on a Norwegian cruise ship, where 
she worked and traveled the world for more than six years, and met her 
late husband, Eugene Lynn. She moved to Boca Raton, and they were 
married in 1980. Her husband didn’t want her to work but wanted to 
support her passion for healthcare. A philanthropist in his own right, he 
introduced her to former FAU College of Nursing Dean Anne Boykin. “I 
remember her taking me to the College of Nursing, which was housed in 
FAU’s Social Sciences building. She said, ‘My dream, one day, is to have 
a standalone College of Nursing.’ Lynn took Boykin’s wish to heart, and 
when her husband passed, she made a $10 million gift to the College, 
which was matched by the state dollar for dollar. The gift enabled the 
College to build its new and enduring home on FAU’s Boca Raton 
campus.
Lynn is proud of the direct impact the College and her gifts have had on 
the community in regard to improving wellness in the community. “When 
I frst came to Boca, it was kind of a sleepy town. And now, almost 40 
years later, I see such growth in different areas of healthcare. It’s amazing 
that people do not need to leave Boca to get care.” She’s also glad that 
many of the 1,200 students enrolled in the College of Nursing remain in 
practice in South Florida, and is proud of the care FAU provides through 
community outreach through centers like the FAU Community Health 
Center, and aiding individuals with memory disorders and their families 
through the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center, among 
other initiatives.
She said, “When I was a nurse, I was happy, never thinking of the things 
my late husband and I have been able to do. After I’m gone, I’ll leave a 
legacy for people to enjoy and to be cured and be cared for, and to me, 
that’s the best gift I could ask for.”

SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
NASTACIA CHAMBERS is pursuing her Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree 
and is a recipient of the Palm Healthcare Foundation scholarship. Her goal is to work in either 
geriatrics or pediatrics, and in the future, she hopes to attend graduate school to become a nurse 
practitioner.  Nastacia chose the nursing profession because of its focus on the meaning of the 
experience to the patient.  Nastacia’s favorite aspect of nursing is caring for individuals during 
their most vulnerable moments. “Whether I’m there to hold a mom’s hand as she welcomes her 
child into the world, or if I’m there to hold a dying man’s hand as he takes his last breath, I am 
caring.” Her scholarship is helping defray expenses and gave her the opportunity to focus more 
on her studies. She most appreciates the College of Nursing’s atmosphere. “The College is calm, 
peaceful and well equipped, which makes it very conducive to learning,” she said.   
MARY GAMBLE
 is a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student. She is a recipient of 
scholarships from the Hugh and Anny Godsey fund, and the Lost Tree Foundation. She is 
preparing to become a family nurse practitioner and is interested in holistic nursing. Her goal is 
to open a holistic-based care practice after obtaining her degree. Mary chose nursing because 
the profession “allows me to help others bring the good out in themselves, whether that is a 
good attitude, health, or inspiration to do something that they never imagined that they would 
be able to do.” Mary was also inspired to pursue a doctoral degree, to make a future impact on 
policy development and healthcare reform. “Through nursing, I am able to educate, advocate, 
encourage, heal, inspire, and support.” Mary is thankful for her scholarship, which allowed her to 
afford tuition without the use of loans. She said, “The College of Nursing exemplifes the art of 
caring. There is healing that takes place as soon as you walk through the doors. The faculty are 
outstandingly educated and take the time to care, and encourage you.” 
 is a student in the Doctor of Nursing Practice (BSN to DNP) program.  
JEANETTE GARCIA
She is a recipient of scholarships from the Hugh and Anny Godsey Scholarship fund, and the 
Helen Shoef Memorial Scholarship fund. After obtaining her degree, she hopes to work in the 
community to help the most vulnerable members of society, including children and minorities.  
She feels that nursing is not just a passion but her calling.  As a mother of four young children 
and a caretaker for four more children, she struggled to attend school full-time and was at a 
crossroads in her education. Her scholarship allowed her to continue her education, and she is 
deeply grateful. Jeanette credits the College’s caring philosophy with changing her life. “While 
incorporating this philosophy into my studies, I found myself actively looking for opportunities to 
care for others.  It led me to discover an entire community living near me which was in desperate 
need of help.” She was inspired to assist local children in obtaining frst-time vaccinations and 
visits to physicians, as well as enrolling them in school, where they now have an opportunity 
to dramatically change the course of their lives.  This led Jeanette to establish a not-for-proft 
organization serving these children called "HOOOTS," Helping Others Out Of The Shadows. 
She appreciates the College of Nursing faculty’s dedication, as well as the many opportunities 
afforded to her through her program.

graduation, he hopes to become a nurse practitioner in a location with a shortage of primary

profession, two of which are his parents, who were both nurses. Also, he was impressed with 
the care he received from nurses during  treatment of a severe arm injury he had in high school. 
“I love how nurses help comfort and care for everyone no matter who they are and no matter 
what they are being treated for,” he said. Anthony greatly appreciates his Lost Tree Foundation 
scholarship, which helps alleviate fnancial stress, as he is fnancing his own education.  He is 
especially appreciative of the College faculty’s dedication to student success, as well as the 
Freshman Direct Admit program, which he is part of. “There is also a special place in my heart 
for all the students in my class and the class ahead of me. Without their kindness and support, it 
would have been a lot harder to get as far as I have come.”

MOULINE GUERRIER is a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student in the Adult Geriatric 
Nurse Practitioner concentration. She is passionate about caring for older people. “The more 
nurses we have that specialize in geriatric care, the safer we can make it for our older adults.” In 
the future, she’d like to practice in an oncology setting or with older adults, and also hopes to be 
an educator. The trust and personalization of nursing is what drew her to the profession. She also 
appreciates the fexibility and diversity of a career in nursing. “You have many choices as a nurse 
– you can go into the legal aspect of nursing, become a healthcare leader or even practice at the 
bedside.” Mouline is deeply grateful for her Palm Healthcare Foundation scholarship. “When you 
are struggling fnancially from semester to semester…knowing in your heart that you can’t quit, no 
matter what – the scholarship shines a new light on the situation.” She appreciates the College

STACEY RAVID
 is pursuing her PhD in Nursing. Stacey became a nurse 24 years ago, when, 
while working as an actress, her father had a stroke. She cared for him in the hospital and fell in 
love with nursing. The nurses and doctors encouraged her, seeing within her the passion and 
talent for caring for others. “I listened to their feedback and knew that nursing was the path for 
me,” she said. Her favorite aspect of the nursing profession is hearing people’s stories. Stacey 
completed her Master’s in Nursing in the role of clinical nurse specialist. She is currently an adjunct 
faculty member with the College. After graduation, she would like to continue to teach nursing 
students at a university level, as well as to conduct research. She said she is grateful and humbled 
by the generosity of donors, like Esther Saylor Rothenberger, who provided her scholarship, which 
has allowed her to focus solely on her studies.  Ravid said, “I love that the College of Nursing’s 
philosophy is based on caring. The faculty members are down to earth, approachable and 
brilliant. The PhD program has elements of creativity. The school, program and faculty honor the 
individuality and uniqueness of each PhD nursing student.”

and extend compassionate care to those in need.  “We take for granted the simple necessities 
of life,” she said. “Tragedy can hit in an instant and completely alter the patient's ability to care 
for themselves. I am honored to have a role in their road to recovery.” She is thankful for her 
scholarship, which was awarded to her in recognition of her academic achievements. “Awards, 
whether monetary or verbal, are fuel for the journey,” she said. She loves that the College’s 
caring philosophy aligns closely with her own and admires the College’s faculty. “The faculty are 
irreplaceable and played a vital role in my success.”

In a rapidly changing world and healthcare landscape, we can all be very proud 
of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, a local and global leader in fostering 
wellness through caring. The College is dedicated to innovatively addressing the 
nursing profession’s most pressing issues, such as the critical shortage of nurses, by 
recruiting the best and brightest students and faculty. Our nationally recognized and 
highly-ranked College is applying a holistic, caring approach to important topics, 
including mental health and healthy aging. The College is strategically engaged 
in research initiatives, such as addressing disparities of care for underserved 
populations, including indigenous populations. Talented students, faculty and staff 
work across academic disciplines and are robustly engaged in community health. 
By providing health care services to a variety of groups, students have opportunities 
to be fully immersed in the community, gaining valuable perspective they will carry 
with them throughout their careers. The College is a respected South Florida 
healthcare partner, serving and strengthening the region through education, 
community-based practice and research. It is helping those most in need while 
inspiring and empowering a new generation of nurses to lead.
It has been my pleasure to serve as the Chair of the College’s Advisory Board for the 
past year. Since 2012, the Board has provided important community linkages and 
support to the College. To properly support any academic college, it takes a strong 
and diverse team of community leaders and advocates who are knowledgeable 
about the healthcare ecosystem. Board members are prominent business leaders 
and humanitarians who serve as ambassadors for the College, sharing its message 
and raising funds to support programs and students. Throughout the past year, 
Advisory Board members remained dedicated to supporting the Lamplighter 
scholarship fund which helps welcome the College’s youngest students, defrays 
many of their frst-year expenses, and encourages their entry into the profession of 
nursing. 
It is a privilege to support the College of Nursing, whose faculty and students are 
extremely impressive in their credentials and achievements.  The peer rankings and 
ratings refect the caliber of faculty and students that the College has attracted, 
placing them among the best of the best. We are proud to support the College 
in the community and look forward to the future with great anticipation as we 
advocate for faculty, students and the mission of the College.
Thank you for your interest in the College. We hope you’ll join us in supporting this 
local treasure. 
Warmly,
Terry Fedele

ounded in 2003 as the educational and fundraising arm of the Louis and Anne Green 
Memory and Wellness Center, a part of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, the Caring 
F
Hearts Auxiliary supports, promotes, and raises funds for the programs of the Memory 
and Wellness Center through community-based fundraising activities, such as the annual Keep 
Memories Alive Walk at Boca Town Center. Funds raised support Day Center scholarships and 
caregiver support programs.
Last fall, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary held their 11th annual Keep Memories Alive Walk, raising over 
$150,000. More than 350 people gathered to support the Memory and Wellness Center. 
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary looks forward to celebrating its 12th annual Keep Memories Alive 
Walk on Sunday, November 5, 2017, themed “Caring Hearts Scores a Touchdown – Scoring 
for Scholarships and Caregiver Support Programs” and anticipates it will be the largest, most 
successful event to date. The walk will begin at 9 a.m. at the Town Center at Boca Raton, and 
participants are encouraged to dress up in support of their favorite football player/team. Prizes will 
be awarded to captains with the highest fundraising and those with the most “team spirit.”
This year’s walk is supported by many community sponsors, including Bobby Campbell, Louis 
& Anne Green, Christine E. Lynn, Steve & Diane Scaggs, The Schmidt Family Foundation, The 
Sylvester Foundation, and Elaine J. Wold.
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary continues its commitment to those in need of comprehensive memory 
and wellness care.
