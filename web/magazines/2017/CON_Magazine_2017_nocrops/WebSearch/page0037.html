Letter from the Advisory Board Chair Teresa “Terry” FedeleIn a rapidly changing world and healthcare landscape, we can all be very proud of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, a local and global leader in fostering wellness through caring. The College is dedicated to innovatively addressing the nursing profession’s most pressing issues, such as the critical shortage of nurses, by recruiting the best and brightest students and faculty. Our nationally recognized and highly-ranked College is applying a holistic, caring approach to important topics, including mental health and healthy aging. The College is strategically engaged in research initiatives, such as addressing disparities of care for underserved populations, including indigenous populations. Talented students, faculty and staff work across academic disciplines and are robustly engaged in community health. By providing health care services to a variety of groups, students have opportunities to be fully immersed in the community, gaining valuable perspective they will carry with them throughout their careers. The College is a respected South Florida healthcare partner, serving and strengthening the region through education, community-based practice and research. It is helping those most in need while inspiring and empowering a new generation of nurses to lead.It has been my pleasure to serve as the Chair of the College’s Advisory Board for the past year. Since 2012, the Board has provided important community linkages and support to the College. To properly support any academic college, it takes a strong and diverse team of community leaders and advocates who are knowledgeable about the healthcare ecosystem. Board members are prominent business leaders and humanitarians who serve as ambassadors for the College, sharing its message and raising funds to support programs and students. Throughout the past year, Advisory Board members remained dedicated to supporting the Lamplighter scholarship fund which helps welcome the College’s youngest students, defrays many of their frst-year expenses, and encourages their entry into the profession of nursing. It is a privilege to support the College of Nursing, whose faculty and students are extremely impressive in their credentials and achievements.  The peer rankings and ratings refect the caliber of faculty and students that the College has attracted, placing them among the best of the best. We are proud to support the College in the community and look forward to the future with great anticipation as we advocate for faculty, students and the mission of the College.Thank you for your interest in the College. We hope you’ll join us in supporting this local treasure. Warmly,Terry FedeleChair, Advisory BoardCollege of NursingBOARD MEMBERS  Maurice PloughNettie Birnbach Holli Rockwell TrubinskyTerry Fedele, Chairwoman Margaret Mary ShuffMichael Filon Marlaine SmithSusan L.
