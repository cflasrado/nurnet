Christine E. Lynn CREATING A LEGACY OF WELL-BEING THROUGH CARINGAt 70, Christine E. Lynn, the College’s namesake philanthropist, refects on a legacy of transformative giving that is providing greater well-being for the community. “Health and wellness are extremely important to me because I have seen so many not getting the care they deserve. To me, the greatest gift is to be able to get the best of care possible for yourself and your family,” she said.Lynn’s relentless dedication to improving care and nursing education is a living, growing legacy impacting FAU, Boca Raton and the South Florida community. She is the principal philanthropist to the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing at FAU, Christine E. Lynn Center for Caring, Anne Boykin Institute for the Advancement of Caring in Nursing, and Nursing Assistant Scholarships, as well as the Boca Raton Regional Hospital’s Christine E. Lynn Heart and Vascular Institute, the Eugene and Christine Lynn Cancer Institute and the Christine E. Lynn Women’s Health and Wellness Institute. She donated to FAU’s sports medicine center in the new Academic-Athletic complex with the expectation that the College of Nursing will be a part of the wellness initiatives there.  She is also supporting forthcoming projects including the Christine E. Lynn Rehabilitation Center and stem cell research at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, as well as other programs and charities. It’s no wonder that when she’s out and about, she hears people whisper, “Do you know who that is? She’s the one who does everything for healthcare,” she said. “I’m amazed, and it touches my heart.”She was inspired to become a nurse by a family friend whose daughter was a nurse working on a cruise ship. Lynn was educated at the university hospital in Oslo, Norway in 1969 and specialized as a surgical nurse before becoming the head nurse on a Norwegian cruise ship, where she worked and traveled the world for more than six years, and met her late husband, Eugene Lynn. She moved to Boca Raton, and they were married in 1980. Her husband didn’t want her to work but wanted to support her passion for healthcare. A philanthropist in his own right, he introduced her to former FAU College of Nursing Dean Anne Boykin. “I remember her taking me to the College of Nursing, which was housed in FAU’s Social Sciences building. She said, ‘My dream, one day, is to have a standalone College of Nursing.’ Lynn took Boykin’s wish to heart, and when her husband passed, she made a $10 million gift to the College, which was matched by the state dollar for dollar. The gift enabled the College to build its new and enduring home on FAU’s Boca Raton campus.Lynn is proud of the direct impact the College and her gifts have had on the community in regard to improving wellness in the community. “When I frst came to Boca, it was kind of a sleepy town. And now, almost 40 years later, I see such growth in different areas of healthcare. It’s amazing that people do not need to leave Boca to get care.” She’s also glad that many of the 1,200 students enrolled in the College of Nursing remain in practice in South Florida, and is proud of the care FAU provides through community outreach through centers like the FAU Community Health Center, and aiding individuals with memory disorders and their families through the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center, among other initiatives.She said, “When I was a nurse, I was happy, never thinking of the things my late husband and I have been able to do. After I’m gone, I’ll leave a legacy for people to enjoy and to be cured and be cared for, and to me, that’s the best gift I could ask for.”FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E.
