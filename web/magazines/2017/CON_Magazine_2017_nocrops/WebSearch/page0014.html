HEALTHY AGING IS ACROSS THE LIFESPANCollege of Nursing faculty advance Caring Science in four focus areas.  One of those areas is Healthy Aging Across the Lifespan.  FAU established the Institute for Healthy Aging and Lifespan Studies (IHeAL) led by Dr. James Galvin, Professor in the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing, to   stimulate research in this area. Healthy Aging begins at birth and requires attention to health across the lifespan. Two examples of externally-funded research focused on promoting well-being through caring are the studies conducted by Dr. Tarsha Jones and Dr. Lisa Wiese. Dr. Tarsha Jones, Assistant Professor, focuses on cancer prevention and control, and the identifcation of minority women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome to promote personalized cancer through researchcare. Black and Hispanic women are more likely to be diagnosed with early onset breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer; yet, they are less likely to undergo genetic counseling/testing to manage their cancer risk. Dr. Jones’ dissertation examined the use of cancer In addition Dr. Jones has been collaborating with genetic services, such as counseling and testing, among researchers from Dana Farber Cancer Institute to study young African-American breast cancer survivors and the feasibility and acceptability of a website intervention found an underutilization of genetic counseling and to promote self-care for survivors of Hodgkin Disease. testing in this population. During her postdoctoral They are designing this website based on the needs of fellowship at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, she this population. conducted a secondary data analysis of 945 Black women diagnosed with breast cancer. Similarly, she Dr. Lisa Wiese, Assistant Professor, has been found an underutilization of BRCA testing. Predictors investigating basic knowledge about Alzheimer’s of BRCA testing were: 1) perceived benefts of BRCA disease in rural older adult populations, using the testing; 2) income, and 3) BRCA mutation risk category. Basic Knowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease (BKAD), which This work was accepted for publication in Cancer she and her colleagues designed for persons with Medicine and is now in press. limited education and health literacy. In comparing Appalachian and Florida rural cohorts, Dr. Wiese found In her current study funded by the DAISY Foundation, that there were signifcant knowledge gaps in both Dr. Jones is conducting a descriptive, cross-sectional populations, a concern for these states and others with qualitative study, using grounded theory methods, to high percentages of older adults. Information regarding understand barriers to genetic testing and the needs the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in largely White of Black and Hispanic women with a cancer risk who Appalachia is unavailable; however, in Dr. Wiese’s home receive care in community health centers. In more state of West Virginia, with a signifcant Appalachian clearly understanding the needs of these populations, population, the prediction is that the incidence of her goal is to promote precision prevention by Alzheimer ’s disease among persons over 65 will designing and testing a technology-based intervention double by 2025.  In areas with a more diverse racial/to increase awareness of cancer risk and to promote ethnic population, such as Florida, there are signifcant informed decision making about cancer risk reduction risk disparities. For example, African-Americans face among minority women to reduce cancer health twice the risk of Alzheimer’s, and Hispanic-Americans disparities. Genetic testing among women, across the are 1.8 times more likely to develop dementia lifespan, provides an opportunity to promote healthy TRANSFORMING CAREthan non-Hispanic Whites.
