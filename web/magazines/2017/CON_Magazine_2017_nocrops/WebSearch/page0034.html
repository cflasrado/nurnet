MeetSCHOLARSHIP STUDENTSNASTACIA CHAMBERS is pursuing her Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree and is a recipient of the Palm Healthcare Foundation scholarship. Her goal is to work in either geriatrics or pediatrics, and in the future, she hopes to attend graduate school to become a nurse practitioner.  Nastacia chose the nursing profession because of its focus on the meaning of the experience to the patient.  Nastacia’s favorite aspect of nursing is caring for individuals during their most vulnerable moments. “Whether I’m there to hold a mom’s hand as she welcomes her child into the world, or if I’m there to hold a dying man’s hand as he takes his last breath, I am caring.” Her scholarship is helping defray expenses and gave her the opportunity to focus more on her studies. She most appreciates the College of Nursing’s atmosphere. “The College is calm, peaceful and well equipped, which makes it very conducive to learning,” she said.   MARY GAMBLE is a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student. She is a recipient of scholarships from the Hugh and Anny Godsey fund, and the Lost Tree Foundation. She is preparing to become a family nurse practitioner and is interested in holistic nursing. Her goal is to open a holistic-based care practice after obtaining her degree. Mary chose nursing because the profession “allows me to help others bring the good out in themselves, whether that is a good attitude, health, or inspiration to do something that they never imagined that they would be able to do.” Mary was also inspired to pursue a doctoral degree, to make a future impact on policy development and healthcare reform. “Through nursing, I am able to educate, advocate, encourage, heal, inspire, and support.” Mary is thankful for her scholarship, which allowed her to afford tuition without the use of loans. She said, “The College of Nursing exemplifes the art of caring. There is healing that takes place as soon as you walk through the doors. The faculty are outstandingly educated and take the time to care, and encourage you.”  is a student in the Doctor of Nursing Practice (BSN to DNP) program.  JEANETTE GARCIAShe is a recipient of scholarships from the Hugh and Anny Godsey Scholarship fund, and the Helen Shoef Memorial Scholarship fund. After obtaining her degree, she hopes to work in the community to help the most vulnerable members of society, including children and minorities.  She feels that nursing is not just a passion but her calling.  As a mother of four young children and a caretaker for four more children, she struggled to attend school full-time and was at a crossroads in her education. Her scholarship allowed her to continue her education, and she is deeply grateful. Jeanette credits the College’s caring philosophy with changing her life. “While incorporating this philosophy into my studies, I found myself actively looking for opportunities to care for others.  It led me to discover an entire community living near me which was in desperate need of help.” She was inspired to assist local children in obtaining frst-time vaccinations and visits to physicians, as well as enrolling them in school, where they now have an opportunity to dramatically change the course of their lives.  This led Jeanette to establish a not-for-proft organization serving these children called "HOOOTS," Helping Others Out Of The Shadows. She appreciates the College of Nursing faculty’s dedication, as well as the many opportunities afforded to her through her program.  is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.  Upon ANTHONY GOLBERGgraduation, he hopes to become a nurse practitioner in a location with a shortage of primary care or mental health professionals.  Anthony has many reasons for becoming part of the nursing profession, two of which are his parents, who were both nurses. Also, he was impressed with the care he received from nurses during  treatment of a severe arm injury he had in high school. “I love how nurses help comfort and care for everyone no matter who they are and no matter what they are being treated for,” he said. Anthony greatly appreciates his Lost Tree Foundation scholarship, which helps alleviate fnancial stress, as he is fnancing his own education.  He is especially appreciative of the College faculty’s dedication to student success, as well as the Freshman Direct Admit program, which he is part of. “There is also a special place in my heart for all the students in my class and the class ahead of me. Without their kindness and support, it would have been a lot harder to get as far as I have come.”FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E. LYNN COLLEGE OF NURSING32
