FACULTY AND DOCTORAL STUDENTS ADDRESS GLOBAL HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH  In response to the World Health Organization’s call for comprehensive, coordinated action to improve global health, College of Nursing faculty and students are engaging in research beyond our borders. Diane Gullett, a doctoral student mentored by Dr. Charlotte through researchBarry, conducted two research studies in collaboration with communities in Haiti. The frst explored the experience of health after the 2010 devastating earthquake. In the second study, her dissertation research still in process, she focused on the experience of suffering through the earthquake. The fndings of this research will provide the knowledge needed by nurses and other healthcare providers caring for persons suffering through a natural disaster. The studies can generate valuable global dialogue with the potential to advance caring science within nursing. In another initiative, faculty and members of the South Florida Haiti Project conducted community health assessments in Bondeau, Haiti. The community identifed the need for basic health services for their children, and in response to this, a nurse-led, school-based wellness center was developed. The need for mental health care also surfaced during the community assessment. This resulted in the design of another study. In March 2017, Drs. Beth King and Charlotte Barry traveled to Haiti to conduct research with a team of volunteers and collaborators. The volunteers included Dr. Marilyn Ray, transcultural nursing scholar and Professor Emeritus, and Sandra Daccarett, a family nurse practitioner and Doctor of Nursing Practice student. Haitian collaborators from the Faculté des Sciences Infrmières de l’Université “Men and women shared their Episcopale d’Haïti in Léogâne (FSIL) included the dean, a nursing instructor, and an undergraduate nursing student. physical, emotional and spiritual The pastor of Bon Samaritan Parish and an interpreter assisted the researchers with data collection. The next steps pain with us, and we offered include bringing the fndings back to the 85 participants for review, and building a community of care providers in hope in our compassion and Haiti to design, implement and evaluate a comprehensive, community-based mental health program.   .presence,” said Dr. RayTRANSFORMING CAREFLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E.
