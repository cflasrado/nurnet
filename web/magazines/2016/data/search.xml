     <text><![CDATA[A Message from the Dean
The theme of this edition of our magazine is “Soaring Higher.” Both Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and 
the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing passionately continue our journey of pursuing excellence in our 
missions of teaching, research/scholarship and service.  In March, FAU was ranked as the top-performing 
public university in the state by the Florida Board of Governors, the body overseeing the State University 
System.  Out of 12 universities, Florida Atlantic soared from a ranking of 11th in 2014 and sixth in 2015 to the 
top spot.  A laser focus on student success contributed to this rise.  We are on our way to President Kelly’s 
goal of becoming the “most improved university in the country.” In like manner, our College of Nursing 
soared into the Top 50 of U.S. News and World Report’ graduate nursing program rankings, with our Master 
of Science in Nursing program ranked 46th, our Doctor of Nursing Practice program ranked 44th, and our 
Online Graduate Programs ranked 42nd.  We rose from a ranking of 72nd last year and 197th previously, and 
are ranked third out of 16 MSN programs in the state.  
The College completed a fve year Strategic Plan (2016-2020) that built upon FAU’s Race to Excellence 
Plan, completed in 2015.  The College plan refects seven pillars: brand, boldness, quality, synergy, place, strategy, and the 
values and relationship focus of the College.   The plan charts our course toward  increasing international prominence in 
caring science; recruiting and retaining the most qualifed and diverse community of faculty, staff and students; developing 
exceptional educational programs, teaching-learning and student support processes; advancing discoveries that improve 
health, healing and quality of life; engaging with our local, regional, national and global communities to meet societal 
needs; wisely allocating resources to support our missions, and creating an environment that supports well-being and 
productivity of our faculty, staff and students.  Faculty, staff, students, alumni, University leaders and our Advisory Board 
contributed to the strategic plan.  More specifcally, Michael Filon, Advisory Board member, consulted with us, challenging 
us to create key performance indicators to measure our progress and hold us accountable to our goals.  
In academic year 2015-16, we enrolled 1,467 students in our four degree programs. We welcomed our second group of 
freshmen direct students, enhanced our Professional Practice lab and simulation, focused on student success, expanded 
our graduate enrollment, and created a welcoming environment for a student body with 55% from underrepresented 
racial-ethnic groups in nursing.  We increased our research funding, and our faculty were featured in the media throughout 
the country for their work in caring for couples with dementia, developing tools to decrease unnecessary hospitalizations 
for nursing home residents, decreasing drug and alcohol use in Native American communities, improving interprofessional 
practice in hospitals, helping older adults and their families make decisions about driving competence, and understanding 
spirituality as a resource following the loss of a child. Our nurse-managed centers and faculty practices continue to expand 
services, providing care to vulnerable populations in need; serving as a clinical site for students from nursing, medicine, 
social work,  psychology and pharmacy;  and a rich research site for faculty.  We are so grateful to our generous donors who 
enabled us to provide $1 million in scholarships, and support faculty excellence and research.
A highlight of our year was ANA President, Dr. Pamela Cipriano’s visit to the College when we hosted the ANA Minority 
Nurse Fellowship Program. She spoke to an audience of faculty, students, alumni, community leaders and ANA Fellows, 
sharing ANA’s vision as the national voice of nursing.
I’ve often heard that healthy growth requires both roots and wings.   Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College 
of Nursing soars ever higher on the wings of our hopes and dreams, always rooted to our missions of advancing caring 
as a science, practicing caring as an art, studying caring in our educational programs, and living caring in our community.  
Sincerely,
Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAAN

printed forms and materials for nursing homes, Med-Pass, 
added the guide to their catalogue, distributed copies at 
conferences, and sent email blasts to inform their customers 
of its availability. 
In response to these multi-pronged approaches to 
translation and dissemination, the response has been 
overwhelmingly positive from residents and family 
members, as well as from those nursing homes that are 
using the guide.  
To date, 173 nursing homes have ordered printed materials 
with the largest orders from Florida, Texas, Ohio and 
Illinois. In the frst six weeks of this summer, there were 699 
visits to the website. There have been numerous requests 
from individuals, as well as nursing home chains, seeking 
permission to distribute the guide throughout their facilities. 
Additionally, an insurance company is planning to feature 
the Decision Guide on its website.
FUTURE EFFORTS
It is Dr. Tappen’s hope that by educating residents, family 
members and providers through the dissemination of the 
guide there will be even further reduction in hospitalization 
rates.

PROFESSIONALS A FORUM TO EXPRESS DEEP 
In Fall 2013, FAU’s College of Nursing launched the exciting 
CONNECTIONS MADE 
new Journal of Art and Aesthetics in Nursing and Health 
Sciences, a professional online, multimedia publication with 
a global reach. This innovative journal provides a forum 
WITHIN THEIR PRACTICE
for nurses, physicians, social workers and others in the 
health sciences to express the caring they fnd within their 
TRANSFORMING CARE
practice through the medium of art and aesthetics. Within 
the versatility of an electronic medium, the 
journal showcases the remarkable talents 
of its contributors, and brings them to life 
in a multi-sensory variety of music, poetry, 
artwork, refective essays and caring science.  
“The exquisite experience of caring and 
being cared for in nursing and healthcare 
is most often rendered invisible and nearly 
always undocumented,” said Dr. Marguerite 
J. Purnell, RN, AHN-BC, Editor. “This journal 
provides a professional venue for caregivers 
to openly express the deep caring in their 
practice and for others to be inspired by 
their dedication and sacrifce.”
Since its inception, the journal has 
developed organically and contributors 
shape each issue theme with their 
submissions. Each issue has its own 
personality, and contributors refect 
the spectrum of healthcare. Nurses 
are represented from students in the 
early stages of their profession to those 
experienced nurses advanced in their 
careers; all offer different dimensions of 
caring for appreciation. Items in the journal 
can be experienced in vivid color, sound 
and motion, and include poetry in the 
authors’ voices, visual art, original music 
compositions and performances, dance, 
sculpture and expositions of caring. Recently, 
a “Behind the Story” section was included, 
through research
featuring various authors and the inspiring 
stories behind their art expressions, offering 
a glimpse of the authors themselves.
“We are continually expanding and refning 
the journal to embrace the evolving and 
complex nature of art expressions submitted 
by our authors. There is no other journal like 
it in healthcare. We are setting the pace,” said Dr. Purnell. 
“The journal can be found within the catalogs of major 
academic library catalogues in the U.S. and Canada, and 
even though we don’t advertise, the journal is becoming 
known across the globe.”
The journal is envisioned as a global repository of caring 
embodied in art forms, and each author’s creative 
expression in the journal is being preserved for future 
generations in the Archives of Caring. There is no fee for 
the fully-online submission process, and all submissions of 
artwork and aesthetic items receive a blinded, peer review 
by an international panel. The journal is published twice a 
year, in the fall and spring. For more information, visit the 
journal’s website at http://jaanhs.org/

SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
SADIKE CLARKE, recipient of the Palm Healthcare Foundation scholarship, is a Master’s 
student in the Family Nurse Practitioner program. Upon graduation, he plans to work as a Family 
Nurse Practitioner in a primary care setting, where he hopes to encourage patients to take 
control of their own health by partnering to promote their health and prevent disease. Sadike 
chose to pursue an advanced nursing degree that allows him to follow his passion for providing 
care. He appreciates the fexibility and diversity of nursing and the ability to work with people 
of all ages, as well as the option to conduct research. Sadike said, “My favorite part of nursing 
is being an advocate and a shoulder for my patients and their family members to lean on in 
their most sensitive and vulnerable moments.” He appreciates opportunities to work with his 
professors in the College. “They are always readily available if I have questions or concerns. FAU 
defnitely prepares students with the necessary tools one needs to become a successful and  
competent nurse.” Sadike is thankful for his scholarship, which helped him purchase books and 
supplies for his studies. It has also helped him inspire friends and family to pursue their dreams by 
demonstrating that there are fnancial resources available to help obtain an education.  
CHRISTOPHER DEMEZIER
 is a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) student in the 
Freshman Direct Admit track and a recipient of the Esther Saylor Rothenberger Fund Scholarship. 
He plans to pursue nursing research opportunities upon graduation. Christopher chose nursing 
because he enjoys serving and helping others. He said, “As a nurse, I will be able to help at a time 
when people are most vulnerable and really need someone for support. I can combine my love for 
science with my calling to serve others in a way that is both tangible and meaningful.” Christopher 
admires the feeling of camaraderie between nurses who work together, as well as collegial ties 
across the profession. He is grateful for his scholarship, which helped him purchase textbooks 
as well as essential supplies, including a stethoscope and a blood pressure cuff. Christopher 
appreciates the caring philosophy of the College, which is refected in interactions with professors, 
advisors and fellow students. “The collection of all of these aspects of the College of Nursing 
creates an environment that is safe, warm and caring,” he said.

of the Lost Tree Village Charitable Foundation Scholarship. Upon graduation and taking the 
NCLEX exam, she looks forward to traveling and plans to explore becoming a Neonatal Intensive 
Care Unit (NICU) nurse, an area she enjoyed during her clinical experience at Coral Springs 
Medical Center.  Carly said, “Growing up around a chiropractor and a massage therapist, I saw the 
joy and wholeness one feels after helping others. After attending the medical magnet program 
at Jupiter Community High School, I was sold. It was my interactions with nurses that made me 
decide nursing would be for me.” She appreciates being able to provide one-on-one care and 
comfort to patients as a nurse. “Bringing hope and one’s authentic presence to a situation can 
make a world of difference to those in need.” Carly is grateful for her scholarship, which helped 
pay for textbooks and classroom programs to prepare for the NCLEX and future practice. “FAU 
is very special to me, and the College is its own small family. There is a special connection and 
bond that we all share while going through this program together. Faculty are very helpful and 
understanding while providing the knowledge base required for this intricate profession.”

“I have chosen to study nursing because my dream is to touch the lives of those who need 
caring the most and to improve the quality of their life.” Ayse hopes to contribute to knowledge 
development in nursing as a researcher, educator and activist, and is currently conducting research 
that could help persons with progressive neurodegenerative disorders. She is grateful for her 
scholarship, which allows her to participate in conferences and training programs, where she can

and a scholarship from the Helen Schoef Fund. Indhira wanted to be in healthcare from a very 
young age and obtained an LPN license at the age of 16, at which time she was too young to 
work. She is thankful for her scholarships, which have enabled her to return to school to pursue 
her dream of becoming a nurse practitioner. Indhira said, “My goal is to transform healthcare 
by providing quality and cost-effective care for older adults through innovative practice models.

 is a PhD student and a recipient of the Esther Saylor Rothenberger Fund 
ASHLEY RIVERA
Scholarship. Ashley plans to work in the area of nursing education at the university level, and 
conduct nursing research after obtaining her degree. She appreciates the many options available 
in a nursing career. Ashley said, “Nursing is a service profession – taking care of patients, families, 
other nurses, other healthcare professionals, or students – sometimes all of them at the same 
time.” Ashley credits her scholarship with greatly reducing the fnancial stress of affording her 
education. She enjoys the Rothenberger scholarship’s focus on the research community and 
opportunities to work with other researchers of various levels of experience. “The research 
component creates a really strong foundation within my career,” she said. Her love of research 
is also why she chose FAU. “My particular program of study pushes you to engage by assisting 
in faculty research projects, writing articles for publication and initiating pilot studies. The 
opportunity to do these things with caring guidance from senior researchers is extremely helpful in 
honing my skills.”

SHA'REN WRAY
is a recipient of the Hugh & Annie Godsey Scholarship and the Burdella Cunningham Scholarship. 
After graduation, she hopes to further her education by obtaining her Doctor of Nursing 
Practice (DNP) degree to become a nurse anesthetist. Sha'Ren was inspired to become a nurse 
after her mother had a health emergency. “It was after watching how my mother was cared for 
that I realized that I wanted to do the same for someone else.”  She appreciates the personal 
interaction nurses have with their patients.  Sha'Ren is grateful for her scholarships for alleviating 
fnancial pressures associated with her education. “Not once did I have to give my attention to 
wondering if I am going to be able to afford something because the scholarships covered my 
educational needs and allowed me to have money to live off of during the semesters.”

Hearts Auxiliary supports, promotes, and raises funds for the programs of the Memory 
and Wellness Center through community-based fundraising activities, such as the annual Keep 
Memories Alive Walk at Boca Town Center. Funds raised support Day Center scholarships and 
caregiver support programs.
“With the funds raised from our Keep Memories Alive Walk held in 2015, the Caring Hearts 
Auxiliary funded 43 Day Center scholarships and underwrote the Sustaining the Caregiver support 
program,” said Terry Fedele, president of the auxiliary board. “We take pride in the ability to 
help relieve stress from caregivers and provide funds to participants in need at the Memory and 
Wellness Center.”
Last fall, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary held their 10th annual Keep Memories Alive Walk, raising more 
than $300,000. More than 400 people gathered to support the Memory and Wellness Center. The 
funds raised are designed to help defray the costs of the Day Center program for families who 
cannot afford it. 
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary looks forward to celebrating its 11th annual Keep Memories Alive 
Walk on Sunday, November 6, 2016, themed “Walking with the Stars,” and anticipates it will be 
the largest, most successful event to date. The walk will begin at 9 a.m. at the Town Center at 
Boca Raton, and participants are encouraged to dress up as their favorite celebrity. Prizes will be 
awarded to captains with the highest fundraising, as well as to those with the best celebrity look-
alike costume.
This year’s walk is sponsored and organized by the following community members: Bobby 
Campbell and Christine E. Lynn, honorary ambassadors; and Bill and Betty Scaggs, honorary chairs. 
The honorary family is Margaret “Peggy” Sinnott and the Lefton family.
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary continues its commitment to those in need of comprehensive memory 
and wellness care, and looks forward to many more years of engaged and dedicated service.
