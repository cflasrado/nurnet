ONLINE JOURNAL OFFERS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS A FORUM TO EXPRESS DEEP In Fall 2013, FAU’s College of Nursing launched the exciting CONNECTIONS MADE new Journal of Art and Aesthetics in Nursing and Health Sciences, a professional online, multimedia publication with a global reach. This innovative journal provides a forum WITHIN THEIR PRACTICEfor nurses, physicians, social workers and others in the health sciences to express the caring they fnd within their TRANSFORMING CAREpractice through the medium of art and aesthetics. Within the versatility of an electronic medium, the journal showcases the remarkable talents of its contributors, and brings them to life in a multi-sensory variety of music, poetry, artwork, refective essays and caring science.  “The exquisite experience of caring and being cared for in nursing and healthcare is most often rendered invisible and nearly always undocumented,” said Dr. Marguerite J. Purnell, RN, AHN-BC, Editor. “This journal provides a professional venue for caregivers to openly express the deep caring in their practice and for others to be inspired by their dedication and sacrifce.”Since its inception, the journal has developed organically and contributors shape each issue theme with their submissions. Each issue has its own personality, and contributors refect the spectrum of healthcare. Nurses are represented from students in the early stages of their profession to those experienced nurses advanced in their careers; all offer different dimensions of caring for appreciation. Items in the journal can be experienced in vivid color, sound and motion, and include poetry in the authors’ voices, visual art, original music compositions and performances, dance, sculpture and expositions of caring. Recently, a “Behind the Story” section was included, through researchfeaturing various authors and the inspiring stories behind their art expressions, offering a glimpse of the authors themselves.“We are continually expanding and refning the journal to embrace the evolving and complex nature of art expressions submitted by our authors. There is no other journal like it in healthcare. We are setting the pace,” said Dr. Purnell. “The journal can be found within the catalogs of major academic library catalogues in the U.S. and Canada, and even though we don’t advertise, the journal is becoming known across the globe.”The journal is envisioned as a global repository of caring embodied in art forms, and each author’s creative expression in the journal is being preserved for future generations in the Archives of Caring. There is no fee for the fully-online submission process, and all submissions of artwork and aesthetic items receive a blinded, peer review by an international panel. The journal is published twice a year, in the fall and spring. For more information, visit the journal’s website at http://jaanhs.org/  15
