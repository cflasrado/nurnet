Lynn College of Nursing Community Health Center is now integrating TRANSFORMING CAREpharmocogenetic testing as part of its psychiatric nurse-led precision care to guide well as Palm Beach Atlantic University’s School of Pharmacy, personalized treatment.  The Center utilizes Arizona State University and University of Florida.  The GeneSight, a genetic test that analyzes multi-state interprofessional project is funded by the Health how a person’s genes can affect the way Resources and Services Administration to provide access to their body responds to FDA-approved nurse-led, high-quality and culturally-sensitive health care medications. Medicines that align well with to diverse populations, and to educate the next generation an individual’s genetic make-up may work of health care professionals in nurse-led, community-based better with fewer side effects.integrated care.GeneSight has four panels that the Center The Center also provides tele-behavioral and diabetes utilizes, including psychotropic, analgesic, services to rural and urban health care partner sites.

Through this panel, providers can ascertain how clients’ genes affect possible response to opioids, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants.•  The Attention Defcit Hyperactivity Disorder panel is for clients who through practicehave been diagnosed with ADHD. Results include identifying genes that can affect a patient’s response to medications prescribed to treat ADHD.•  The MTHFR panel provides information on the individual’s folic acid conversion.  It tests for genetic causes of folate defciency, which may be more prevalent among depressed patients.  As a result of the Center utilizing genetic testing, nurse practitioners are able to make even better treatment decisions.  11
