SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTSJENNIFER PETERSON is pursuing a Doctor of Nursing Practice (BSN-DNP) degree that will prepare her as a Family Nurse Practitioner. She is a recipient of the Evelyn Weinberger scholarship and the Helen Morley scholarship. After completing her degree, Jennifer plans to work in a family practice and eventually open a clinic of her own. Originally, she had planned to go to medical school after becoming a registered nurse, but fell in love with nursing and decided to become a nurse practitioner. Jennifer said, “My favorite aspect of nursing is the relationships with the patients - connecting with them on a human level.” She appreciates the College’s caring-based approach to education, and said, “Faculty embrace each student as an individual, encouraging excellence in their uniqueness and creating phenomenal nurses.  The BSN-DNP program, while rigorous, is a blessing for those who want to earn their DNP in a shorter time frame than the traditional route.” Jennifer is grateful for the scholarships, which allow her to focus more on her studies and her children. “I cannot express enough gratitude for the generosity bestowed upon me.  I am extremely thankful.”INDHIRA PIQUION is a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student in the Adult-Gerontology Nurse Practitioner program. She is a recipient of the Rotary Club of Boca Raton scholarship and a scholarship from the Helen Schoef Fund. Indhira wanted to be in healthcare from a very young age and obtained an LPN license at the age of 16, at which time she was too young to work. She is thankful for her scholarships, which have enabled her to return to school to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse practitioner. Indhira said, “My goal is to transform healthcare by providing quality and cost-effective care for older adults through innovative practice models. I want to establish patient and family-centered holistic care coordination, as well as to improve interdisciplinary communications.”  is a PhD student and a recipient of the Esther Saylor Rothenberger Fund ASHLEY RIVERAScholarship. Ashley plans to work in the area of nursing education at the university level, and conduct nursing research after obtaining her degree. She appreciates the many options available in a nursing career. Ashley said, “Nursing is a service profession – taking care of patients, families, other nurses, other healthcare professionals, or students – sometimes all of them at the same time.” Ashley credits her scholarship with greatly reducing the fnancial stress of affording her education. She enjoys the Rothenberger scholarship’s focus on the research community and opportunities to work with other researchers of various levels of experience. “The research component creates a really strong foundation within my career,” she said. Her love of research is also why she chose FAU. “My particular program of study pushes you to engage by assisting in faculty research projects, writing articles for publication and initiating pilot studies. The opportunity to do these things with caring guidance from senior researchers is extremely helpful in honing my skills.” is pursuing a traditional Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, and SHA'REN WRAYis a recipient of the Hugh & Annie Godsey Scholarship and the Burdella Cunningham Scholarship. After graduation, she hopes to further her education by obtaining her Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree to become a nurse anesthetist. Sha'Ren was inspired to become a nurse after her mother had a health emergency. “It was after watching how my mother was cared for that I realized that I wanted to do the same for someone else.”  She appreciates the personal interaction nurses have with their patients.  Sha'Ren is grateful for her scholarships for alleviating fnancial pressures associated with her education. “Not once did I have to give my attention to wondering if I am going to be able to afford something because the scholarships covered my educational needs and allowed me to have money to live off of during the semesters.” 33
