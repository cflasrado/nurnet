FIRST STAGE:  THE RESEARCH STUDYSECOND STAGE: TRANSLATION INTO PRACTICEFour years ago, Dr. Ruth Tappen assembled a highly This important next stage following completion of the talented interdisciplinary research team made up of a research study was to move the Decision Guide from representative from nursing, medicine, psychology, and the academic arena into practice. This was a complex, liberal arts to complete a ground breaking study focused challenging and time intensive process. The frst step on why nursing home residents and their families request involved creating a website where the guide was easily being sent to the hospital if a change in condition occurs, available and copies could be downloaded. The guide was even when the needed care can be provided in the translated from English into the fve most commonly used nursing home.  This is an important concern as the Centers languages in the U.S., including Spanish, French, Chinese, for Medicare and Medicaid estimated that the cost of Haitian, Creole and Filipino.

One of the major suppliers of printed forms and materials for nursing homes, Med-Pass, added the guide to their catalogue, distributed copies at conferences, and sent email blasts to inform their customers of its availability. In response to these multi-pronged approaches to translation and dissemination, the response has been overwhelmingly positive from residents and family members, as well as from those nursing homes that are using the guide.  To date, 173 nursing homes have ordered printed materials with the largest orders from Florida, Texas, Ohio and Illinois. In the frst six weeks of this summer, there were 699 visits to the website. There have been numerous requests from individuals, as well as nursing home chains, seeking permission to distribute the guide throughout their facilities. Additionally, an insurance company is planning to feature the Decision Guide on its website.FUTURE EFFORTSIt is Dr. Tappen’s hope that by educating residents, family members and providers through the dissemination of the guide there will be even further reduction in hospitalization rates.
