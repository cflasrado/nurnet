A Message from the DeanThe theme of this edition of our magazine is “Soaring Higher.” Both Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing passionately continue our journey of pursuing excellence in our missions of teaching, research/scholarship and service.  In March, FAU was ranked as the top-performing public university in the state by the Florida Board of Governors, the body overseeing the State University System.  Out of 12 universities, Florida Atlantic soared from a ranking of 11th in 2014 and sixth in 2015 to the top spot.  A laser focus on student success contributed to this rise.  We are on our way to President Kelly’s goal of becoming the “most improved university in the country.” In like manner, our College of Nursing soared into the Top 50 of U.S. News and World Report’ graduate nursing program rankings, with our Master of Science in Nursing program ranked 46th, our Doctor of Nursing Practice program ranked 44th, and our Online Graduate Programs ranked 42nd.  We rose from a ranking of 72nd last year and 197th previously, and are ranked third out of 16 MSN programs in the state.  The College completed a fve year Strategic Plan (2016-2020) that built upon FAU’s Race to Excellence Plan, completed in 2015.  The College plan refects seven pillars: brand, boldness, quality, synergy, place, strategy, and the values and relationship focus of the College.   The plan charts our course toward  increasing international prominence in caring science; recruiting and retaining the most qualifed and diverse community of faculty, staff and students; developing exceptional educational programs, teaching-learning and student support processes; advancing discoveries that improve health, healing and quality of life; engaging with our local, regional, national and global communities to meet societal needs; wisely allocating resources to support our missions, and creating an environment that supports well-being and productivity of our faculty, staff and students.  Faculty, staff, students, alumni, University leaders and our Advisory Board contributed to the strategic plan.  More specifcally, Michael Filon, Advisory Board member, consulted with us, challenging us to create key performance indicators to measure our progress and hold us accountable to our goals.  In academic year 2015-16, we enrolled 1,467 students in our four degree programs. We welcomed our second group of freshmen direct students, enhanced our Professional Practice lab and simulation, focused on student success, expanded our graduate enrollment, and created a welcoming environment for a student body with 55% from underrepresented racial-ethnic groups in nursing.  We increased our research funding, and our faculty were featured in the media throughout the country for their work in caring for couples with dementia, developing tools to decrease unnecessary hospitalizations for nursing home residents, decreasing drug and alcohol use in Native American communities, improving interprofessional practice in hospitals, helping older adults and their families make decisions about driving competence, and understanding spirituality as a resource following the loss of a child. Our nurse-managed centers and faculty practices continue to expand services, providing care to vulnerable populations in need; serving as a clinical site for students from nursing, medicine, social work,  psychology and pharmacy;  and a rich research site for faculty.  We are so grateful to our generous donors who enabled us to provide $1 million in scholarships, and support faculty excellence and research.A highlight of our year was ANA President, Dr. Pamela Cipriano’s visit to the College when we hosted the ANA Minority Nurse Fellowship Program. She spoke to an audience of faculty, students, alumni, community leaders and ANA Fellows, sharing ANA’s vision as the national voice of nursing.I’ve often heard that healthy growth requires both roots and wings.   Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing soars ever higher on the wings of our hopes and dreams, always rooted to our missions of advancing caring as a science, practicing caring as an art, studying caring in our educational programs, and living caring in our community.  Sincerely,Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAANDean and Helen K. Persson Eminent Scholar1
