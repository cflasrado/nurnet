EEPKMEThe Caring Hearts Auxiliary Continues MORits Support of the Louis and Anne Green IESALIMemory and Wellness CenterVECaring Hearts Auxiliary Board of Directors (Renea Austin is absent from the photo.)ounded in 2003 as the educational and fundraising arm of the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center, a part of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, the Caring FHearts Auxiliary supports, promotes, and raises funds for the programs of the Memory and Wellness Center through community-based fundraising activities, such as the annual Keep Memories Alive Walk at Boca Town Center. Funds raised support Day Center scholarships and caregiver support programs.“With the funds raised from our Keep Memories Alive Walk held in 2015, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary funded 43 Day Center scholarships and underwrote the Sustaining the Caregiver support program,” said Terry Fedele, president of the auxiliary board. “We take pride in the ability to help relieve stress from caregivers and provide funds to participants in need at the Memory and Wellness Center.”Last fall, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary held their 10th annual Keep Memories Alive Walk, raising more than $300,000. More than 400 people gathered to support the Memory and Wellness Center. The funds raised are designed to help defray the costs of the Day Center program for families who cannot afford it. The Caring Hearts Auxiliary looks forward to celebrating its 11th annual Keep Memories Alive Walk on Sunday, November 6, 2016, themed “Walking with the Stars,” and anticipates it will be the largest, most successful event to date. The walk will begin at 9 a.m. at the Town Center at Boca Raton, and participants are encouraged to dress up as their favorite celebrity. Prizes will be awarded to captains with the highest fundraising, as well as to those with the best celebrity look-alike costume.This year’s walk is sponsored and organized by the following community members: Bobby Campbell and Christine E. Lynn, honorary ambassadors; and Bill and Betty Scaggs, honorary chairs. The honorary family is Margaret “Peggy” Sinnott and the Lefton family.The Caring Hearts Auxiliary continues its commitment to those in need of comprehensive memory and wellness care, and looks forward to many more years of engaged and dedicated service.FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E.
