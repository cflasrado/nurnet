     <text><![CDATA[A Message from the Dean
The 2014-15 academic year was a very successful one for FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of 
Nursing.  President Kelly unveiled a new FAU Strategic Plan, “The Race to Excellence,” and 
the College of Nursing is now ambitiously charting a course to our promising future. We were 
pleased by our meteoric rise in the U.S. News & World Report rankings for top graduate 
programs in nursing, moving from 197 to 72.  The ranking is based on both objective criteria, 
where we excelled, and subjective ratings from deans across the country.  
We continue to be recognized globally as a premier College of Nursing with a mission focused 
on advancing caring science within the discipline of nursing through research, teaching and 
practice/service.  The Anne Boykin Institute for the Advancement of Caring in Nursing held 
two inaugural events: a colloquium modeled after TED Talks in which fve prominent scholars 
presented short papers, followed by substantial dialogue; and a Summer Academy focused on 
teaching grounded in caring science.  Both events drew participants from around the world.  We 
continue to expand our global infuence through partnerships with Australia, Canada, Guatemala, Thailand, 
Japan, Taiwan, Uganda, China and Brazil.  
Over the past year, approximately 1,900 students were enrolled in the College in four degree programs.  The 
College admitted its frst freshmen class of nearly 100 students directly into the nursing major. Half of these 
students received Lamplighter scholarships from generous donors, who, through their support, helped to 
facilitate the beginning of these students’ educational journey in nursing.  Overall, more than $1 million in 
scholarships, traineeships and stipends were awarded to students this year. 
Our faculty are known for their research and scholarship in caring science in the areas of healthy aging, health 
equity, holistic health and transforming practice environments.  Several are engaged in research funded by fve 
grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.  Research 
expenditures increased to $2.5 million this year, and faculty were prolifc in producing articles and books.  
Twelve faculty are fellows in the American Academy of Nursing. 
Two caring-based, nurse-managed health centers, the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center 
and FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing Community Health Center, continue to thrive, offering care to 
the most vulnerable, while serving as a site for interprofessional education and faculty research.  Faculty are 
also practicing within other sites, including Village Academy, Slattery Child Development Center and a shelter 
associated with Aids to Victims of Domestic Abuse.  
All this has been possible through the dedication of our faculty, staff, students and community partners. I am 
grateful to our donors, most notably Christine E. Lynn, for her continuous unwavering support. We could not 
experience these successes without her.
The Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is embracing FAU’s new motto of “Unbridled Ambition” as we 
continue to pursue excellence, expand our infuence and engage with our communities.  We look forward to 
the coming year!
Sincerely,
Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAAN

A member of the Cherokee Tribe, and one of only 20 
doctorally-prepared Native American nurses in the nation, 
Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing Professor John Lowe is 
a leading voice for advancing culturally conscious healthcare 
for Native Americans. 
Dr. Lowe, FAU’s John F. Wymer Distinguished Professor, 
has been awarded more than $10 million to study the use 
of tribal talking circles as a substance abuse intervention in 
tribes located within the United States. His current fve-
year research project, titled “Intertribal Talking Circle for 
the Prevention of Substance Abuse in Native Youth,” got 
underway in 2014. The project works with sixth graders 
in three tribal communities – the Ojibwe/Chippewa in 
Minnesota; Choctaw in Oklahoma; and Lumbee in North 
Carolina.
Dr. Lowe’s most recent work is expanding the talking circle 
through research
intervention, and the College’s community engagement 
reach to Australia and Canada. Following contact by 
aboriginal and indigenous researchers from universities and 
communities interested in developing similar projects, Dr. 
Lowe is developing dynamic partnerships that can make the 
College of Nursing a hub for research in indigenous nursing. 
More recently, Dr. Lowe negotiated a Memorandum of 
Understanding between FAU and the University of Southern 
Queensland in Australia, where he is a visiting scholar and 
member of the advisory board of the university’s Centre for 
Rural and Remote Area Health. His latest funded research 
project, titled “Testing a Substance Abuse Intervention 
for Aboriginal Australian Early Adolescents,” received the 
Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing’s Dean’s Award for 
Senior Investigator Research Advancement. The study will 
work with an Aboriginal Australian community partnership 
committee to tailor and implement the talking circle as 
an intervention for substance abuse among Aboriginal 
Australian youth. 
Dr. Lowe and his research team have also been invited to 
tailor and implement the talking circle intervention among 
First Nations communities across Canada. He also serves on 
the international research review committee of the Canadian 
Institute of Health Research.
“Dr. Lowe’s work with Indigenous populations in Australia 
and Canada continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
working within cultures using evidence-based, culturally-
tailored tools such as the talking circle.” said Dr. Marlaine 
Smith, Dean of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. 
“We are proud of all he is doing on a global scale to 
advance caring.”

Partner to support Collaboration among 
varied healthcare Professions
Caring for patients in an acute care setting in a hospital requires a team 
approach and involves a multitude of healthcare professionals, including 
nurses, attending physicians, residents, case managers, pharmacists and 
clinical psychologists, to name a few. Each of these professions enters into 
practice with different skills sets, knowledge and professional identities 
that contribute to patient care. Yet, in many circumstances, barriers exist 
Transforming Care
between disciplines that can obstruct a team-based system.
The College of Nursing and Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine have partnered with Boca Raton Regional Hospital 
(BRRH) on an innovative one-year project funded by The Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. The project titled, “Aligning Education 
and Practice to Support Interprofessional Collaboration,” has been designed to bridge the gap between what is being taught 
in academia and lived in practice. Currently, FAU’s nursing, medical and social work students come together to learn nationally 
recommended interprofessional competencies. 
The objective of this project is to align academic and healthcare delivery system partners to create practice environments in 
the hospital setting, which support interprofessional collaboration and quality patient-centered outcomes. The project will 
initially focus on the discharge process at BRRH and will take place on three different units where care teams partner with 
patients and families within the hospital’s organization. 
The project team includes two faculty members in FAU’s College of Nursing, Drs. Terry Eggenberger and Kathryn Keller, and 
the director of FAU’s internal medicine residency program, Dr. Bernard Obeso. “By taking an interprofessional approach to 
training, we are building the crucial communication and teambuilding skills that are essential to support collaboration and 
quality patient-centered outcomes,” said Dr. Eggenberger. 
This project is an extension of initial work supported by a Christine E. Lynn research grant in FAU’s College of Nursing, which 
focused on interviews with frontline providers from nursing, medicine, pharmacy and case management to determine where 
interprofessional competencies could be strengthened. 
Strategies and interventions of the new project will include interprofessional rounds with healthcare providers, development of 
faculty and practice champions, and the creation of a repository for resources to support the initiative.

Researchers noted that caregivers often accepted a spouse’s 
version of the story, valuing the relationship more than 
being right. “These caring ways of communicating help us 
understand what is possible in marital relationships affected 
by Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Williams. “Revealing how 
couples interact can be a source of strength to those who 
feel hopeless, discouraged and ready to give up, and can 
empower nurses to reach out to couples.”
Findings from the study are published in the International 
Journal of Human Caring.

ANGELA PRESTIA,  PhD, '14
DISTINUISHED ALUMNUS
recent graduate, Dr. Angela Prestia earned her Ph.D. in Nursing 
in December 2014, an achievement that is one of the latest over a 
a 
distinguished, nearly 40-year career. Since 2009, she has served as 
the Chief Nursing Offcer of Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm 
Beach, a role she previously held at Jupiter Medical Center.
Dr. Prestia was born in Manhattan and moved to Garden City, Long 
Island at the age of 10. Then, fve years later, her family moved 
to Pembroke Pines. When it was time to choose a career, she 
said, “My mother was a huge infuence on me. She said, ‘Get an 
education and be able to support yourself.’ My father was also 
very supportive. At the time, I wanted to be a writer. My mother 
suggested I become a nurse because I was good at science.”
Dr. Prestia received her BSN degree at the University of West 
Florida in 1979 and went on to earn a Master of Science 
degree in Nursing at Vanderbilt University in 1985. 
She is passionate and committed to advancing the profession 
of nursing by developing nurse leaders, helping them meet 
challenges and problem-solve to do what is in the best interest 
of the patient. In addition, she shares her knowledge as a 
new adjunct professor at FAU, having taught an online course 
on clinical informatics to 37 students as her frst foray in to 
teaching in higher education, only a semester after completing 
her doctorate. 
Outside of the offce, she is an avid swimmer, loves to read and 
enjoys spending time outdoors. “People would be surprised 
to learn that I’ve ridden on the back of a motorcycle from South 
Florida to Pennsylvania,” she said. “I love being on the back of a 
motorcycle and seeing the countryside. It gives me time to think.”
While few nurse executives contribute to the nursing literature, Dr. 
Prestia is the author of fve recent peer-reviewed publications on nursing 
leadership.  “I’m excited to now have the opportunity to write and 
research, a lifelong interest of mine.” 
Among other organizations, she is a member of the American 
Organization of Nurse Executives. The FAU National 
Alumni Association named her Distinguished Alumnus 
for 2015, and she also received the 2014 Rising Star 
Award from FAU’s Graduate College. She was part 
of the winning team for Tenet Corporation’s Circle 
of Excellence in both 2011 and 2012.  She was 
also a nominee for Palm Healthcare Foundation’s 
2012 Nursing Distinction Awards for the “Nursing 
Leadership” and “Extra Mile” categories.  Under 
her leadership, the hospital has received several 
accreditations and accolades, including being named 
a comprehensive community-based cancer center and 
chest pain center of excellence.  
Both of Dr. Prestia’s children are FAU graduates, her son 
Richard graduated in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in 
health and exercise science, and her daughter Chelsea 
graduated in 2013 with her MPA.

DAMIAN EKER,  DNP, '02, '06
OUTSTANDINg YOUNg OwL
r. Damian Eker was the frst alumnae from the Christine E. Lynn College of 
Nursing to receive the distinction of Outstanding Young Owl (OYO) at the 
d
inaugural OYO event sponsored by FAU’s National Alumni Association. 
Dr. Eker is a certifed geriatric nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist 
in geriatrics at the Adult and Geriatric Health Center in Fort Lauderdale. 
He has taught the primary care practicum as an adjunct professor in the 
College of Nursing since the Fall semester of 2014, and mentors nursing 
students from FAU and FIU.
Born in Jamaica, Dr. Eker’s family moved to Florida when he was fve 
years old.  His inspiration for a career in nursing came as a result of an 
accident-prone childhood, as he was often treated for broken bones. 
“I chose nursing because of experiences I had with nurses. They were 
great care providers. They were always going above and beyond, and 
you could tell that they genuinely cared.”
In addition, Dr. Eker’s father encouraged him to become a nurse. He 
enrolled at FAU for his BSN in 1999, and he knew he had made the right 
decision when he met his professors. “A college is just a building – what 
makes a college great is its professors. Good professors are priceless,” he 
said.
Dr. Eker earned his BSN and dual MSN degrees from FAU, and his DNP 
degree from the University of Florida. While at FAU, he was honored as the 
2002 Florida Board of Nursing student of the year. He was also inducted 
into Sigma Theta Tau International in 2002 and Golden Key National Honor 
Society in 2001. 
Dr. Eker loves his work as a nurse practitioner, including talking with 
patients, educating them and impacting outcomes. He is passionate 
about geriatric nursing and working with the elderly. “The most 
important thing to me is the patient and how that patient feels.” 
Outside of work, he enjoys being a dad to his three 
children, including nine-year-old twins Alexander and 
Samantha, and 16-year-old Gabriel. He has 
also volunteered as a soccer coach for 
his children, and for another local 
soccer team for children with 
Down Syndrome and autism. 
Dr. Eker’s wife, Amy, is also 
a nurse, working at Joe 
DiMaggio Children’s 
Hospital in the 
pediatric intensive 
care unit.

NURSINg STUDENTS 
wITH gENEROUS gIFT
hilanthropist Victor Oristano is making a major impact in the lives of 
P
four members of the College of Nursing’s inaugural freshman class.
Mr. Oristano established the Oristano Scholarship Fund as a way to 
contribute to the greater good and give back to entrepreneurial 
individuals lacking the fnancial resources to complete their 
education. He became interested in supporting 
nursing and FAU through his neighbor, Dr. Ellen 
Baer, a retired faculty member and nursing expert.
“He became intrigued with nursing,” said Dr. 
Baer. “Through his gift to FAU, he could help 
deserving students achieve their educational 
goals, and at the same time help expand 
the number of people with access to a 
nursing education. Nursing offered him the 
opportunity to combine his interests - he’s a 
believer in helping causes that are good for 
the world,” she said.
The timing of Mr. Oristano’s gift to the 
College was perfect, as the frst cohort of 
students were entering their freshman year 
as part of the College’s inaugural freshman 
class when the scholarship debuted. To 
fully support the students throughout 
their undergraduate careers, Mr. Oristano 
has generously given each student $5,000 
in their frst year and has pledged to give 
the same amount for the next three years 
if they remain in good standing.
Mr. Oristano was involved in the cable 
television industry from 1960 to 2013 
as a builder and operator of systems 
in Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania and England.

ELIzABETH FORCE,   PhD
AU’s College of Nursing established the Dr. Elizabeth E. Force 
Chair for Healthcare Research when Dr. Force, who retired from 
F
Merck – Medical Affairs, pledged a generous estate gift to the 
FAU Foundation to bring a national leader in nursing research to serve 
in a key leadership role in the College. Based on her experience as 
a medical researcher, Dr. Force realized the importance of nursing 
research focused on preventing disease, relieving suffering and 
improving health. 
“I began thinking about my resources, and how they could be put to 
use to advance nursing research and offer something unique to FAU. 
It makes me happy to know that someone’s full time job will be to lead 
research,” said Dr. Force. “The information FAU nursing students gain will 
continually stimulate the highest level of care for our community.” 
Dr. Force’s lifelong passion for science was evident early on, from playing 
with a chemistry set as a child to being the only woman in her pre-med 
program at Temple University. She went on to work for pharmaceutical 
giants Smith Kline and Merck while pursuing post-graduate work, frst at 
the University of Pennsylvania and then George Washington University 
Medical School, where she completed her PhD in clinical 
epidemiology and environmental health. Her early career in 
pharmaceutical research included work on the polio 
vaccine. Then later, as executive director of the 
Medical Regulatory Standards Section, 
she was responsible for fnal approval 
of drug studies for NDA inclusion, 
drug labeling and scientifc quality 
assurance, as well as working 
directly with the FDA.
“We are so incredibly 
grateful to Dr. Force for her 
 
generous legacy gift to the 
College by establishing the 
Dr. Elizabeth E. Force Chair 
for Healthcare Research,” 
said Dr. Marlaine Smith, 
Dean of the College of 
Nursing. “Her passion 
for research will endure 
and enhance the 
education of nursing 
students for many 
years to come.”

The funds raised are designed to help defray the costs of the Day Center program for families who 
cannot afford the cost. 
Keep Memories Alive was sponsored and organized by the following community members: Bobby 
Campbell, presenting sponsor; philanthropist Elaine J. Wold, honorary chairwoman; and Sy and 
Anita Flaster, honorary chairs. In addition to her role with the Walk, Mrs. Flaster, an art student, 
provides her talents to the Memory and Wellness Center’s Artful Memories Program, primarily 
creating landscape and foral paintings. 
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary also held its Shades of Green fundraiser on April 11, 2015, in the home 
of Mr. and Mrs. Robert and Robin Muir, longtime supporters of the Memory and Wellness Center, 
raising $90,000. The Shades of Green fundraiser began over the St. Patrick’s Day holiday ten years 
ago at The Wishing Well. The event quickly grew and moved on to the home of Christine E. Lynn, 
Milhous Museum, Raemali King home, Baldwin House, Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and 
Bobby Campbell home.
The Caring Hearts Auxiliary continues its commitment to those in need of comprehensive memory 
and wellness care, and looks forward to many more years of engaged and dedicated service. 
Yearly dues are $25 and $300 for a lifetime membership to the Auxilliary. To join, please call
