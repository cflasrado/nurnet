A Message from the DeanThe 2014-15 academic year was a very successful one for FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing.  President Kelly unveiled a new FAU Strategic Plan, “The Race to Excellence,” and the College of Nursing is now ambitiously charting a course to our promising future. We were pleased by our meteoric rise in the U.S. News & World Report rankings for top graduate programs in nursing, moving from 197 to 72.  The ranking is based on both objective criteria, where we excelled, and subjective ratings from deans across the country.  We continue to be recognized globally as a premier College of Nursing with a mission focused on advancing caring science within the discipline of nursing through research, teaching and practice/service.  The Anne Boykin Institute for the Advancement of Caring in Nursing held two inaugural events: a colloquium modeled after TED Talks in which fve prominent scholars presented short papers, followed by substantial dialogue; and a Summer Academy focused on teaching grounded in caring science.  Both events drew participants from around the world.  We continue to expand our global infuence through partnerships with Australia, Canada, Guatemala, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Uganda, China and Brazil.  Over the past year, approximately 1,900 students were enrolled in the College in four degree programs.  The College admitted its frst freshmen class of nearly 100 students directly into the nursing major. Half of these students received Lamplighter scholarships from generous donors, who, through their support, helped to facilitate the beginning of these students’ educational journey in nursing.  Overall, more than $1 million in scholarships, traineeships and stipends were awarded to students this year. Our faculty are known for their research and scholarship in caring science in the areas of healthy aging, health equity, holistic health and transforming practice environments.  Several are engaged in research funded by fve grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.  Research expenditures increased to $2.5 million this year, and faculty were prolifc in producing articles and books.  Twelve faculty are fellows in the American Academy of Nursing. Two caring-based, nurse-managed health centers, the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center and FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing Community Health Center, continue to thrive, offering care to the most vulnerable, while serving as a site for interprofessional education and faculty research.  Faculty are also practicing within other sites, including Village Academy, Slattery Child Development Center and a shelter associated with Aids to Victims of Domestic Abuse.  All this has been possible through the dedication of our faculty, staff, students and community partners. I am grateful to our donors, most notably Christine E. Lynn, for her continuous unwavering support. We could not experience these successes without her.The Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is embracing FAU’s new motto of “Unbridled Ambition” as we continue to pursue excellence, expand our infuence and engage with our communities.  We look forward to the coming year!Sincerely,Marlaine C. Smith, RN, PhD, AHN-BC, FAANDean and Helen K. Persson Eminent Scholar1
