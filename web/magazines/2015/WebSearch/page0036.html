MeetELIzABETH FORCE,   PhDAU’s College of Nursing established the Dr. Elizabeth E. Force Chair for Healthcare Research when Dr. Force, who retired from FMerck – Medical Affairs, pledged a generous estate gift to the FAU Foundation to bring a national leader in nursing research to serve in a key leadership role in the College. Based on her experience as a medical researcher, Dr. Force realized the importance of nursing research focused on preventing disease, relieving suffering and improving health. “I began thinking about my resources, and how they could be put to use to advance nursing research and offer something unique to FAU. It makes me happy to know that someone’s full time job will be to lead research,” said Dr. Force. “The information FAU nursing students gain will continually stimulate the highest level of care for our community.” Dr. Force’s lifelong passion for science was evident early on, from playing with a chemistry set as a child to being the only woman in her pre-med program at Temple University. She went on to work for pharmaceutical giants Smith Kline and Merck while pursuing post-graduate work, frst at the University of Pennsylvania and then George Washington University Medical School, where she completed her PhD in clinical epidemiology and environmental health. Her early career in pharmaceutical research included work on the polio vaccine. Then later, as executive director of the Medical Regulatory Standards Section, she was responsible for fnal approval of drug studies for NDA inclusion, drug labeling and scientifc quality assurance, as well as working directly with the FDA.“We are so incredibly grateful to Dr. Force for her  generous legacy gift to the College by establishing the Dr. Elizabeth E. Force Chair for Healthcare Research,” said Dr. Marlaine Smith, Dean of the College of Nursing. “Her passion for research will endure and enhance the education of nursing students for many years to come.” FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E.
