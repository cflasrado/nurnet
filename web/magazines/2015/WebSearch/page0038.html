EEPKMEThe Caring Hearts Auxiliary Continues MORits Support of the Louis and Anne Green IESALIMemory and Wellness CenterVECaring Hearts Auxiliary Board Members (from left to right) – Debbie Lindstrom, Vanessa Boltz, Patricia Thomas, Holli Rockwell Trubinsky, Morgan Green, Terry Fedele, Elaine English, Evie Zimmerman, Marion Godin (not pictured: Liz Dudley)ounded in 2003 as the educational and fundraising arm of the Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center, a part of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, the Caring FHearts Auxiliary supports, promotes, and raises funds for the programs of the Memory and Wellness Center through community-based fundraising activities, such as the annual Keep Memories Alive Walk at Boca Town Center and the Shades of Green event held each spring. Funds raised support Day Center scholarships and caregiver programs.“With the funds raised from our events held in 2014, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary has provided an average of 27 Day Center scholarships per month and dedicated $100,000 towards caregiver support programs,” said Terry Fedele, President of the Auxiliary Board. “We take pride in the ability to help relieve stress from caregivers and provide funds to participants in need at the Memory and Wellness Center.”Last fall, the Caring Hearts Auxiliary held their ninth annual Keep Memories Alive Walk, raising more than $200,000. Four hundred people gathered to support the Memory and Wellness Center. The funds raised are designed to help defray the costs of the Day Center program for families who cannot afford the cost. Keep Memories Alive was sponsored and organized by the following community members: Bobby Campbell, presenting sponsor; philanthropist Elaine J. Wold, honorary chairwoman; and Sy and Anita Flaster, honorary chairs. In addition to her role with the Walk, Mrs. Flaster, an art student, provides her talents to the Memory and Wellness Center’s Artful Memories Program, primarily creating landscape and foral paintings. The Caring Hearts Auxiliary also held its Shades of Green fundraiser on April 11, 2015, in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert and Robin Muir, longtime supporters of the Memory and Wellness Center, raising $90,000. The Shades of Green fundraiser began over the St. Patrick’s Day holiday ten years ago at The Wishing Well. The event quickly grew and moved on to the home of Christine E. Lynn, Milhous Museum, Raemali King home, Baldwin House, Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Bobby Campbell home.The Caring Hearts Auxiliary continues its commitment to those in need of comprehensive memory and wellness care, and looks forward to many more years of engaged and dedicated service. Yearly dues are $25 and $300 for a lifetime membership to the Auxilliary. To join, please call  561-297-4066.FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E. LYNN COLLEGE OF NURSING36
