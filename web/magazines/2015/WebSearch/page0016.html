College of NursiNg researCh has global reaCh serviNg Native aNd iNdigeNous  PeoPleA member of the Cherokee Tribe, and one of only 20 doctorally-prepared Native American nurses in the nation, Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing Professor John Lowe is a leading voice for advancing culturally conscious healthcare for Native Americans. Dr. Lowe, FAU’s John F. Wymer Distinguished Professor, has been awarded more than $10 million to study the use of tribal talking circles as a substance abuse intervention in tribes located within the United States. His current fve-year research project, titled “Intertribal Talking Circle for the Prevention of Substance Abuse in Native Youth,” got underway in 2014. The project works with sixth graders in three tribal communities – the Ojibwe/Chippewa in Minnesota; Choctaw in Oklahoma; and Lumbee in North Carolina.Dr. Lowe’s most recent work is expanding the talking circle through researchintervention, and the College’s community engagement reach to Australia and Canada. Following contact by aboriginal and indigenous researchers from universities and communities interested in developing similar projects, Dr. Lowe is developing dynamic partnerships that can make the College of Nursing a hub for research in indigenous nursing. More recently, Dr. Lowe negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding between FAU and the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, where he is a visiting scholar and member of the advisory board of the university’s Centre for Rural and Remote Area Health. His latest funded research project, titled “Testing a Substance Abuse Intervention for Aboriginal Australian Early Adolescents,” received the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing’s Dean’s Award for Senior Investigator Research Advancement. The study will work with an Aboriginal Australian community partnership committee to tailor and implement the talking circle as an intervention for substance abuse among Aboriginal Australian youth. Dr. Lowe and his research team have also been invited to tailor and implement the talking circle intervention among First Nations communities across Canada. He also serves on the international research review committee of the Canadian Institute of Health Research.“Dr. Lowe’s work with Indigenous populations in Australia and Canada continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of working within cultures using evidence-based, culturally-tailored tools such as the talking circle.” said Dr. Marlaine Smith, Dean of the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “We are proud of all he is doing on a global scale to advance caring.”Transforming CareFLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY      CHRISTINE E. LYNN COLLEGE OF NURSING14
