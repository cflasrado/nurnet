fau and boca raton regional hospital Partner to support Collaboration among varied healthcare ProfessionsCaring for patients in an acute care setting in a hospital requires a team approach and involves a multitude of healthcare professionals, including nurses, attending physicians, residents, case managers, pharmacists and clinical psychologists, to name a few. Each of these professions enters into practice with different skills sets, knowledge and professional identities that contribute to patient care. Yet, in many circumstances, barriers exist Transforming Carebetween disciplines that can obstruct a team-based system.The College of Nursing and Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine have partnered with Boca Raton Regional Hospital (BRRH) on an innovative one-year project funded by The Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. The project titled, “Aligning Education and Practice to Support Interprofessional Collaboration,” has been designed to bridge the gap between what is being taught in academia and lived in practice. Currently, FAU’s nursing, medical and social work students come together to learn nationally recommended interprofessional competencies. The objective of this project is to align academic and healthcare delivery system partners to create practice environments in the hospital setting, which support interprofessional collaboration and quality patient-centered outcomes. The project will initially focus on the discharge process at BRRH and will take place on three different units where care teams partner with patients and families within the hospital’s organization. The project team includes two faculty members in FAU’s College of Nursing, Drs. Terry Eggenberger and Kathryn Keller, and the director of FAU’s internal medicine residency program, Dr. Bernard Obeso. “By taking an interprofessional approach to training, we are building the crucial communication and teambuilding skills that are essential to support collaboration and quality patient-centered outcomes,” said Dr. Eggenberger. This project is an extension of initial work supported by a Christine E. Lynn research grant in FAU’s College of Nursing, which focused on interviews with frontline providers from nursing, medicine, pharmacy and case management to determine where interprofessional competencies could be strengthened. Strategies and interventions of the new project will include interprofessional rounds with healthcare providers, development of faculty and practice champions, and the creation of a repository for resources to support the initiative.alzheimer’s study explores Caring through CommunicationWhen one spouse is affected by Alzheimer ’s disease,  wasn’t working in their relationships, we looked at patterns communication within a relationship provides a way to  supporting intimacy,” said Dr. Williams.connect through caring.
