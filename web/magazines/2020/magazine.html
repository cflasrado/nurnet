	  Our College’s commitment to being caring-centric in who we are and all we do, as well as our leadership in caring science is what drew me to FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. This, in combination with our diverse, talented student body, staff and faculty, and our trifecta of holistic education, clinical and service opportunities, and research programs makes the College a model for global nursing excellence like no other. I can sincerely state: I absolutely love Florida Atlantic University and our College of Nursing; our community of faculty, staff, students, alumni, donors, and all of our campus, clinical and community partners. I remain grateful to our College community, and Drs. Boykin and Smith for paving the way and creating a strong legacy for the College over the past four decades.<br />
      The past 40 years of our College’s history have been phenomenal. We have top ranked, accredited educational programs that are endorsed by the American Holistic Nurses Association. Graduates of our BSN program have the top 1% highest NCLEX pass rates in Florida and across the nation. Our faculty have obtained funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration to support innovative educational and training opportunities for our students, including those who are veterans. The College’s research portfolio has grown exponentially. Our faculty have successfully secured funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and other external sources to support their cutting-edge research. Additionally, several faculty hold prestigious national and international fellowships, including those in the American Academy of Nursing, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the National Academies of Practice. Several faculty have also been selected for state and national awards for excellence in research, education and practice.<br />
      Our College of Nursing is also unique in having two nurse-led clinical health centers: The Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center (MWC) and the FAU Community Health Center (CHC). The MWC, which is based less than a mile away from the College, offers evidence-based programs and high quality, inter-professional, team-based care to participants in the Adult Day Center and patients in the Memory Disorder Clinic. The CHC, located in the Westgate area, continues to meet the health needs of a very vulnerable and underserved population—the majority of whom are uninsured or underinsured. We continue to seek additional funding sources to support the center and its patients, especially since we did not receive funding through the Federally Qualified Health Center program as a new access point. However, we remain committed to caring. </td>

	  This issue of Transforming Care celebrates the 40th anniversary of FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. The theme of our anniversary year is “Honoring our Past…Visioning our Future,” so this is a time for us to both reflect on where we’ve been and where we want to go. As the Dean for the past eight years, I have been privileged to lead talented and dedicated faculty, staff and students who embraced a vision of excellence, expansion and engagement. I’m proud of how we’ve worked together to realize this vision.<br />
      The College was built on a foundation of excellence. Our commitment to advancing caring science in the missions of teaching, research and service has distinguished the College. We are known for our focus on holistic, person-centered caring. We have continued to showcase the uniqueness and excellence of the College. This excellence has been recognized as we rose in the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings to the top 50 for our graduate programs and in the top 25 for our online graduate programs. Our NCLEX pass rates and nurse practitioner certification pass rates are among the best in the Florida, and our graduates are sought after by employers. We’ve grown our scholarly productivity and increased external funding for faculty research. The College is recruiting top students to our programs, and we are one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation. Most of our amazing alumni are practicing in South Florida, and they are making a difference in the health of our communities. Our excellent faculty have received honors from local, state and national organizations.<br />
      The College expanded enrollment and educational programs. In 1979, the program began as a small RN to BSN program and has grown to enroll about 1,400 students in four degree programs. In 2014, the College launched its freshman direct admit track and nearly quadrupled pre-licensure enrollment. A psychiatric mental-health nurse practitioner concentration was developed in 2016 to address the critical lack of access to behavioral healthcare in the region. A new part-time second degree program started at the Davie campus in Fall 2019. Our two nurse-led interprofessional centers have expanded their services and reach. The Louis and Anne Green Memory and Wellness Center added a new building and programs for those with Parkinson’s Disease and their families. The College of Nursing Community Health Center in Westgate is planning to co-locate in the northwest community. </td>

      “I am so proud that our college is recognized nationally and internationally for its commitment to truly focus on the study of nursing as a discipline and to advance the knowledge of caring science. We are the only college to have an Archives of Caring in Nursing that is dedicated to preserving the history of caring in nursing. Students and scholars from across the world access the Archives to study the works of caring scholars. This is a special gift that will continue to grow in importance over the years.” – <strong>Anne Boykin, PhD, Dean Emeritus</strong></td>

      Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing has a rich and impressive history that continues to be written today. The College dates back to 1979 when a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program originated as a division within the College of Social Sciences at FAU. The original BSN began as an RN to BSN track with 10 students enrolled in the program at FAU’s Boca Raton campus.</td>

      Many nurses are retiring and with the aging population of South Florida, a critical nursing shortage is anticipated. Identifying this need in the community, FAU’s College of Nursing launched a new second-degree part-time track in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at FAU’s Davie campus. The College of Nursing currently has an accelerated BSN track for those with a previous BS or BA degree, but those admitted must quit their jobs due to the intensity of the program. This part-time program accommodates those who need to continue working while studying.</td>

		<span style="font-weight: bold">Faculty and Students Enhance Manuscripts with Writing Workshops</span><br />
      FAU’s College of Nursing hosted a series of Manuscript Writing Groups over the past year. Five bi-weekly groups convened, comprised of 3-5 participants, and organized into clusters of faculty members and PhD students. This was a new initiative, directed by the College’s Research Office, intended to support faculty and PhD student scholarship. Participants incrementally worked on manuscripts for publication while receiving feedback from peers. <br />
	  For participants, the groups were a valuable aid to their scholarship, providing space to reflect on research results and refine dissemination of findings. Participants noted how the groups helped them stay “on track” with their manuscripts.

      It is a very exciting time at the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. On behalf of the Advisory Board, we could not be more proud to celebrate all we’ve accomplished in our first 40 years. We’ve come a long way since offering the first RN-BSN degree, with approximately 10 students in 1979, to enrolling more than 1,100 students in four degree programs at the Boca Raton, Davie and Harbor Branch campuses. Now, we are nationally and internationally recognized for our pioneering role in advancing caring science, and there are nearly 7,000 College of Nursing alumni, the majority of whom reside and provide health care to the population of South Florida.</td>
