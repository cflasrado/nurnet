magazine – Answering the Call to Care. The “Lady with the 
Lamp” is recognized worldwide for professionalizing nursing roles 
and highlighting both the science and art of nursing. The year 
2020 marks the 200th anniversary of Nightingale’s birth and was 
designated the “International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife” 
by the World Health Organization for the vital role nurses play in 
providing health services. 
This year, we have seen just how profoundly important nurses are 
to our society and world. Shortly after 2020 began, we started 
to witness the impact of COVID-19 on our country and in our 
communities. From emergency rooms to health clinics, nurses – 
including our own students and alumni – are on the frontlines. 
Dealing with the dynamic and fuid environment that is life in a world 
with COVID-19, I am very thankful to our faculty, staff and students 
who stepped up to the challenge in a variety of ways. Faculty and 
staff were able to swiftly move classes and operations online, and 
provide a continuity of excellent education for our students. Our 
students pivoted to online learning, and were able to complete in-
patient and out-patient clinicals in a variety of settings.

COVID-19, College of Nursing faculty developed and offered a

also helped to raise funds for scholarships for students in need.

Although we have learned a great deal since those early days of

challenges on the path forward, I am heartened to know that 
everyone involved with the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing 
is passionate about the education of nurses, and their role in the

experiencing. Tis allows students and faculty to focus on the essence of what 
really matters.  
Te College’s philosophy grounded in caring reaps enormous accomplishments. 
Some of these accomplishments are evident in the diversity of the graduates 
in each program. Blacks and Hispanic persons represent almost 50 percent of 
graduates from all degree programs. Te College’s MSN and DNP programs 
rank in the top 5 percent in the nation. Te BSN NCLEX pass rates for frst-
time test takers are in the top 1 percent in the nation. Last year, graduates of the 
adult/gerontological nurse practitioner concentration achieved a 100 percent 
pass rate on their certifcation exam. 
In 2020, U.S. News and World Report ranked FAU’s College of Nursing #7 
for its online MSN degree program. Tis ranking was achieved as a result of 
outstanding faculty. Several faculty are fellows of the American Academy of 
Nursing and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and two faculty are 
fellows of the National Academies of Practice. Equally important, 100 percent 
of graduate faculty hold doctorate degrees in nursing or related health felds. 
Te College also has an excellent eLearning department with highly qualifed 
instructional designers who provide over 80 hours of training to faculty and 
assist faculty with online course delivery. 
“As we celebrate the year of the Nurse and the Midwife, nurses are the most 
trusted of all professions,” said Dr. Karethy Edwards, Associate Dean for 
Academic Programs. “I believe this means we continue to answer calls for 
care, and we focus on what matters to patients, families, communities, but also 
society.” 
As our nation and world becomes more complex, nursing education takes 
a leading role in addressing these complexities and challenges. One of the

“I live and love nursing. It’s not ‘what I do.’ Rather, it is ‘who I am.’ Talk to any nurse. 
He or she will say, ‘I am a nurse,’ not ‘I work as a nurse’. I think therein lies the 
fundamental heart of nursing.”

Wisconsin in the Medical ICU (MICU) turned COVID-ICU. It is a Level 1 trauma/

Misako Nagata, PhD, 2020
Misako Nagata’s PhD journey embodied what she really felt excited about: nature 
immersion. Her life and work immersed contrasting nature: high-tech intensive-
care vs. high-touch self-care; allopathic nursing vs. holistic nursing; the Western 
culture vs. the Eastern culture; and high-rise buildings vs. high-relief trees. Te 
COVID-19 pandemic shifed her worldview. She believes the application of nature 
immersion could be benefcial for those who engage in one’s own health, healing, 
and well-being. Te phenomena of nature immersion continuously inspires her to 
sow the seeds of the new global stage of research and practice: integrative nursing.

a century, now more than ever, the world is reminded of the 
importance of nursing. Our work supporting FAU’s Christine E. Lynn
