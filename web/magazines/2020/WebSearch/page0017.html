As future nurse scientists, PhD graduates are mentored on how to build a program of research that contributes to the well-being of individuals and communities.“What really attracted me most to this role is my passion for teaching and mentoring future nursing scholars. I have learned the seeds of academic career success are woven and intertwined with caring mentoring relationships. Mentors serve as caring teachers, wisdom-givers, guides, advocates, coaches, guardians, role models, and as sponsors to students. Te distilling of counsel, support, advise, knowledge, opportunity, and friendship that arise out of professional mentoring relationships profoundly beneft a student’s career development,” said Dr. Howard Butcher. n|  15
