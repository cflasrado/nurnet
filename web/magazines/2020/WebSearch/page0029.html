Connectingwith College of Nursing Alumni CLASS NOTES  Misako Nagata, PhD, 2020Misako Nagata’s PhD journey embodied what she really felt excited about: nature immersion. Her life and work immersed contrasting nature: high-tech intensive-care vs. high-touch self-care; allopathic nursing vs. holistic nursing; the Western culture vs. the Eastern culture; and high-rise buildings vs. high-relief trees. Te COVID-19 pandemic shifed her worldview. She believes the application of nature immersion could be benefcial for those who engage in one’s own health, healing, and well-being. Te phenomena of nature immersion continuously inspires her to sow the seeds of the new global stage of research and practice: integrative nursing.
